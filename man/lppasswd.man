.SH DESCRIPTION

user, \fIlppasswd\fR will prompt for the old and new passwords.
When run by the super-user, \fIlppasswd\fR can add new accounts
(\fI-a username\fR), change existing accounts (\fIusername\fR),
or delete accounts (\fI-x username\fR) in the digest password
file. Digest usernames do not have to match local UNIX usernames.

.TP 5
-g groupname
.br
Specifies a group other than the default system group.
.SH SECURITY ISSUES
The \fIlppasswd\fR command is installed setuid to root. While
every attempt has been made to make it secure against exploits
that could grant super-user privileges to unprivileged users,
paranoid system administrators may wish to disable or change the
ownership of the program to an unprivileged account.
