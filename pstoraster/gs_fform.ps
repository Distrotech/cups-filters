% gs_fform.ps
% Monochrome Form caching implemented in PostScript.

% This implementation is pretty unreasonable:
%	- It doesn't remember transparent pixels.
%	- It reduces everything to black and white.
%	- It doesn't handle halftone or Pattern phasing.
% However, it's good enough to produce some useful output.

% In order to prevent restore from clearing the cache, we explicitly
% push the cache entries on the stack before a restore and reinstall them.
