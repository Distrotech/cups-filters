<P>This whitepaper describes the Common UNIX Printing
System<SUP>TM</SUP> ("CUPS<SUP>TM</SUP>"), a portable and extensible
printing system for UNIX<SUP>&reg;</SUP>. CUPS is being developed by
Easy Software Products, a small business located in Hollywood, Maryland
that has been selling commercial software for Silicon
Graphics<SUP>&reg;</SUP>, Sun<SUP>&reg;</SUP>, and HP workstations
since 1993 through more than 30 distributors serving over 80 countries
worldwide.

<P>Additional information on CUPS is available on the World Wide Web at
"<A HREF="http://www.cups.org">http://www.cups.org</A>".

<H2>Background</H2>

Printing within UNIX has historically been done using one of two
printing systems - the Berkeley Line Printer Daemon ("LPD") [RFC1179]
and the AT&amp;T Line Printer system. Replacements for these printing
systems have emerged [LPRng, Palladin, PLP], however none of the
replacements change the fundamental capabilities of these systems.

<P>Over the last few years several attempts at developing a standard
printing interface have been made, including the draft POSIX Printing
standard [IEEE-1387.4, last updated in 1994] and Internet Printing
Protocol [IETF-IPP]. The POSIX printing standard defines a common set
of command-line tools as well as a C interface for printer
administration and print jobs. The Internet Printing Protocol defines
extensions to the HyperText Transport Protocol 1.1 [RFC2068] to provide
support for remote printing services.

<H2>Weaknesses in Existing Printing Systems</H2>

Easy Software Products has identified several major weaknesses in
the printing systems currently in use:

<OL>

	<LI>Users must print text or Adobe<SUP>&reg;</SUP>
	PostScript<SUP>TM</SUP> files; other formats <I>may</I> be
	supported, but not universally.

	<LI>Lack of a standard command-line interface; each operating
	system and driver package provides different command-line
	options, e.g. setting the media size with one driver may
	involve passing a single option ("letter") while another
	requires two ("mediasize letter").

	<LI>Lack of a standard application interface; most UNIX
	applications either do not provide an interface for sending
	printer options, or restrict the options to those in printer
	description files supplied with the application.

	<LI>Remote printing problems; no vendor seems to use the same
	remote printing protocol (many use an "enhanced" version of the
	LPD protocol with vendor-specific extensions).

	<LI>Client printer administration hassles; most vendors
	require that you install remote printers on each client by
	hand, and many do not even provide the ability to browse
	printers on the "server" system.

	<LI>Drivers typically are hardcoded to handle printing to
	parallel or serial printers; support for other types of
	interfaces or networking protocols requires that a driver be
	rewritten to support them.

	<LI>Security, accounting, and quotas; most printing systems do
	not support access control lists ("ACLs"), and printer
	accounting and quotas are not well supported, if at all.

</OL>

<H2>Goals of CUPS</H2>

The basic goals of CUPS are:

<OL>

	<LI>Provide standard support for text (US ASCII, UTF-8, and
	ISO-8859-x), Adobe PostScript, PDF, HP-GL/2, TIFF, JPEG, PNG,
	PBM, PGM, PPM, GIF, SGI RGB, Sun Raster, and Kodak
	PhotoCD<SUP>TM</SUP> files.

	<LI>Provide a standard command-line interface with a standard
	minimum set of options (media size and so forth).

	<LI>Provide a standard application interface.

	<LI>Provide a common remote printing interface (IPP).

	<LI>Provide a printer browsing interface and allow users to
	print to remote printers using a "printer@server" notation
	rather than adding the printer locally.

	<LI>Provide a scheduler extension interface to support
	different interfaces separate from the printer driver (e.g.
	serial, parallel, lpd, tftp, ipp, etc.)

	<LI>Provide a standard interface for ACLs, quotas, accounting,
	and logging.

</OL>

<H2>Design Overview</H2>

Like most printing systems, CUPS is designed around a central print
scheduling process that dispatches print jobs, processes administrative
commands, provides printer status information to local and remote
programs, and informs users as needed. Figure 1 shows the basic
organization of CUPS.

<H3>Scheduler</H3>

The scheduler is a HTTP/1.1 server application that handles HTTP
requests. Besides handling printer requests via IPP POST requests, the
scheduler also acts as a full-featured web server for documentation and
status monitoring.

<P>The scheduler also monitors the LAN for printer browsing information
and dispatches print jobs as needed using the appropriate filters and
backends.

<H3>Configuration Files</H3>

The configuration files consist of:

<UL>

	<LI>A HTTP server configuration file.

	<LI>Printer and class definition files.

	<LI>MIME type and conversion rule files.

	<LI>PostScript Printer Description (PPD) files.

</UL>

The HTTP server configuration file is purposely similar to the
Apache server configuration file and defines all of the access control
properties for the server.

<P>The printer and class definition files list the available printer
queues and classes.

<P>The MIME type files list the supported MIME types (text/plain,
application/postscript, etc.) and "magic" rules for automatically
detecting the format of a file.  These are used by the HTTP server to
determine the <I>Content-Type</I> field for <I>GET</I> and <I>HEAD</I>
requests, and by the IPP request handler to determine the file type
when a <I>Print-Job</I> request is received with a
<I>document-format</I> of <I>application/octet-stream</I>.

<P>The MIME conversion rule files list the available filters. These
files are augmented by <I>AddFilter</I> entries in the printer
definition files. The filters are used when a job is dispatched so that
an application can send a convenient file format to the printing system
which then converts the document into a printable format as needed.

<P>The PPD files describe the capabilities of PostScript printers.  There is
one PPD file for each printer.

<H3>CUPS Interface Library</H3>

The CUPS interface library contains CUPS-specific convenience functions
for queuing print jobs, etc.  It also contains functions to access
resources via HTTP and IPP, perform MIME typing and conversion, and
manipulate PPD files.

<H3>Filters</H3>

A filter program reads from the standard input or from a file if a
filename is supplied. All filters must support a common set of options
including printer name, job ID, username, job title, number of copies,
and job options. All output is sent to the standard output.

<H3>Backends</H3>

A backend program is a special filter that writes incoming data to a
device or network connection. Backends for serial, parallel, LPD, TFTP,
FTP, IPP, SMB, and AppSocket (JetDirect) connections are provided in
CUPS 1.0.

<H2>Berkeley and System V Commands</H2>

CUPS provides the System V and Berkeley command-line interfaces
for submitting jobs and checking the printer status. The "lpstat" and
"lpc status" commands also show network printers ("printer@hostname")
when printer browsing is enabled.

<P>The System V administation commands are supplied for managing
printers local to the system. The Berkeley printer administration tool
("lpc") is only supported in a "read-only" mode to check the current
status of the printer queues and scheduler.

<H2>Summary</H2>

The Common UNIX Printing System provides a modern printing interface
for UNIX applications that is both flexible and user-friendly. The
software provides System V and Berkeley compatible command-line
interfaces to ensure compatibility with existing applications.

<H2>Licensing</H2>

CUPS is available under the terms of the Aladdin Free Public
License, which means that it is basically free except for commercial
distribution. Vendors wishing to license CUPS for their printing
