<P>This document describes the new features in CUPS 1.2. If you
have never used CUPS before, read the <A

CUPS 1.2 adds many new features to CUPS 1.1.x:</P>

<H2 CLASS="title"><A NAME="NETWORKING">Networking</A></H2>

<--
1. Networking
   a. IPv6
        i. Next-generation Internet support
       ii. ????
   b. Domain sockets
        i. Enhanced performance under load for local clients.
       ii. Authentication without passwords on platforms that support it.
-->

<P>CUPS 1.2 adds support for IPv6 and domain sockets. The IPv6
support allows CUPS to work with the next-generation Internet as
well as taking advantage of automatic local network
configuration. Domain sockets provide 5 to 10 times faster
printing from the desktop.</P>


<H2 CLASS="title"><A NAME="BROWSING">Printer Browsing</A></H2>

<--
2. Printer Browsing
   a. CUPS browsing updates
        i. "Delete" bit for printers
       ii. "lease-time" for printers so that clients and servers don't need
          the same browse timeout/interval settings
      iii. Additional attributes/default options for network-wide defaults
       iv. Network default printer
        v. Ability to control send and receive protocols independently
   b. Rendevous support
   c. LDAP support
   d. Per-printer sharing
-->

<P>CUPS 1.2 adds support for Bonjour/mDNS and LDAP-based printer
sharing. Printers can be shared or "published" individually,
allowing a server to only share specific printers, and you can
set which protocols to use for local and remote printers.
Previously CUPS would share all or none of its printers and use
the same protocols for local and remote printers.</P>

<H3>CUPS Browse Protocol</H3>

<P>The CUPS browse protocol has also been upgraded. New type
bits, authenticated, default, and deleted, provide key
information to clients. The "authenticated" type bit tells
clients that the print queue requires authentication when
printing. The "default" type bit tells clients that the print
queue should be used as the default unless the user sets a
different one. The "deleted" type bit is set when a printer is
deleted from the server - this allows the client to remove its
copy of a printer immediately rather than waiting for it to
timeout.</P>

<P>Previously, a change to the BrowseTimeout setting on the
server had to be mirrored to each client. Browse packets now
include printer lease time information which allows the server to
use a different timeout setting than its clients, making
configuration simpler and more reliable.</P>

<P>Browse packets can also now contain connection options to be
used when printing to the server. This allows the administrator
to require encryption or compress print jobs for certain
printers. This is most often used when printing over
limited-bandwidth WAN connections.</P>
