     The CUPS backend interface provides a  standard  method  for
     sending document files to different physical interfaces.

     Backends must be capable of reading from a filename  on  the
     command-line  or from the standard input, copying stdin to a
     temporary if required by the physical interface.

     The command name (argv[0]) is set to the device URI  of  the
     destination printer.

     The following environment variables are defined by the  CUPS
     server when executing the backend:

     CHARSET
          The default text character set (typically  us-ascii  or
          iso-8859-1).

     CONTENT_TYPE
          The  MIME  type  associated   with   the   file   (e.g.
          application/postscript).

     DEVICE_URI
          The device-uri associated with  the  printer;  this  is
          provided for shell scripts which may not be able to get
          the passed argv[0] string.

     LANG
          The default language locale (typically C or en).

     PATH
          The standard execution path for external programs  that
          may be run by the backend.

     PPD
          The full pathname of the PostScript Printer Description
          (PPD) file for this printer.

     PRINTER
          The name of the printer.

     RIP_CACHE
          The recommended amount of  memory  to  use  for  Raster
          Image Processors (RIPs).
