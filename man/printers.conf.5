       The _p_r_i_n_t_e_r_s_._c_o_n_f file defines the local printers that are
       available. It is normally located in the _/_e_t_c_/_c_u_p_s  direc-
       tory  and  is generated automatically by the _c_u_p_s_d_(_8_) pro-
       gram when printers are added or deleted.

       Each line in the file can be a configuration directive,  a
       blank  line,  or a comment. Comment lines start with the #
       character.
