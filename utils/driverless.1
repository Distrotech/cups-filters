.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdriverless\fP generates PPD files for printers which are designed
for driverless printing (currently IPP Everywhere and AirPrint
printers) by polling capability information from the printers via
IPP. it can be either called for listing suitable printers in the
network and for actually generating the PPD. It can also be called by
CUPS when CUPS is listing available PPDs/drivers or creating print
queues, making the setup of driverless printers with printer setup
tools transparently working.
.P
driverless is placed in /usr/lib/cups/driver/ for listing available
driverless-capable printers and generating PPDs for them. It should
also be put in /usr/lib/cups/backend/ (preferably by a symbolic link)
to list IPP device URIs for suitable printers. Printer setup tools
like system-config-printer, the CUPS web interface at
http://localhost:631/, and CUPS' command line utilities can use
driverless with CUPS to list available driverless-capable printers,
determine their IPP device URIs and generate PPDs for them. The
printers will be automatically and correctly set up for driverless
printing. Note that driverless printing requires IPP communication
with the printer.
.P
A second symbolic link to /usr/lib/cups/driver/driverless from
/usr/bin/ allows driverless to be called directly by a user.
