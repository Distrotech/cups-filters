<H2>Identification</H2>

<P>This document provides an overview of the Internet Printing Protocol
("IPP") version 1.1 as implemented in the Common UNIX Printing System
("CUPS") version 1.2.

<EMBED SRC="system-overview.shtml">

<H2>Document Overview</H2>

<P>This document is organized into the following sections:

<UL>
	<LI><A HREF="#1">1 - Scope</A>
	<LI><A HREF="#2">2 - References</A>
	<LI><A HREF="#3">3 - Overview</A>

<H1>Overview</H1>

<P>CUPS 1.1 implements IPP/1.1 and the operations and attributes
defined in the "IPP: Job and Printer Set Operations",
"IPP/1.1: Output-bin Attribute Extension", and "IPP/1.1: finishings
'fold',' trim', and 'bale' attribute values extension" specifications.

<P>CUPS also provides 13 new operations and many new attributes to
support multiple IPP printers and printer classes on a single host.

<H2>IPP URIs</H2>

<P>CUPS supports both the "http" and "ipp" methods. The following
resource names are used:

<DL>

	<DT>method://hostname:port/

	<DD>Can be used for all "get" operations.

	<DT>method://hostname:port/admin

	<DD>Used for all administrative operations.

	<DT>method://hostname:port/classes/name

	<DD>Specifies a printer class.

	<DT>method://hostname:port/jobs/id

	<DD>Specifies a job.

	<DT>method://hostname:port/printers/name

	<DD>Specifies a printer.

</DL>

<P>So a typical printer URI would be "ipp://foo.bar.com/printers/LaserJet".

<P>In addition, the CUPS server also supports normal browser access to
"method://hostname:port/admin/", "method://hostname:port/classes/",
"method://hostname:port/jobs/", and "method://hostname:port/printers/"
to view and manage resources on the server dynamically.

<H2>CUPS IPP Operations</H2>

<P>CUPS provides 13 extension operations in addition to most of the
standard IPP and registered extension operations:

<UL>

	<LI>"file" - a disk file.

	currently used for Centronics, IEEE-1284, and USB printer
	ports.

identification string provided by the printer connected to the device.
If the device or printer does not support identification then this
attribute contains the string "unknown".

<H3>device-uri (uri)</H3>

<P>The device-uri attribute specifies a unique identifier for the
device. The actual format of the device-uri string depends on the value
of the device-class attribute:

<UL>

	<LI>"file" - The device-uri will be of the form
	"file:/path/to/filename".

	<LI>"direct" - The device-uri will be of the form
	"method:/dev/filename", where method may be "parallel" or "usb"
	in the current implementation.

	<LI>"serial" - The device-uri will be of the form

	The flow value can be one of "none", "soft" (XON/XOFF
	handshaking), "hard" or "rts/cts" (RTS/CTS handshaking),
	or "dtrdsr" (DTR/DSR handshaking).

	<P>The URI returned by CUPS-Get-Devices will contain the
	maximum baud rate supported by the device and the best
	type of flow control available ("soft" or "hard").

	<LI>"network" - The device-uri will be of the form
	"method://[username:password@]hostname[:port]/[resource]",
	where method may be "http", "ipp", "lpd", "smb", or
	"socket" in the current implementation.

	<P>The URI returned by CUPS-Get-Devices will only contain
	the method name followed by two slashes ("method://").
	It is up to the client application to add the appropriate
	host and other information when adding a new printer.

	<P>The URI returned by Get-Printer-Attributes and
	CUPS-Get-Printers has any username and password information
	stripped; the information is still stored and used by the
	server internally to perform any needed authentication.

<H3>ppi (integer(1:MAX))</H3>

<P>The ppi attribute specifies the resolution of an image file in pixels
per inch. The default value is the resolution included with the file or
128 if no resolution information is available.

<H3>prettyprint (boolean)</H3>

<P>The prettyprint attribute specifies whether text files should be printed
with a shaded header and keyword highlighting (prettyprint=true) or without
additional formatting (prettyprint=false). The default value is false.

<H3>saturation (integer(0:200))</H3>

<P>The saturation attribute specifies the color saturation when
printing image files. A saturation of 100 is normal, while values of 50
and 200 will be half and twice as colorful, respectively. The default
value is 100.

<H3>scaling (integer(1:1000))</H3>

<P>The scaling attribute specifies the scaling of image files with
respect to the selected media. A value of 100 specifies that the image
file should fit 100% of the page, or as much as possible given the

value is true.

<H2>PPD Attributes</H2>

<H3>ppd-natural-language (naturalLanguage)</H3>

<P>The ppd-natural-language attribute specifies the language encoding

<H3>ppd-make (text(127))</H3>

<P>The ppd-make attribute specifies the manufacturer of the printer
(the Manufacturer attribute in the PPD file). If the manufacturer
is not specified in the PPD file then an educated guess is made using
the NickName attribute in the PPD file.

<H3>ppd-make-and-model (text(127))</H3>

<P>The ppd-make-and-model attribute specifies the manufacturer and model
name of the PPD file (the NickName attribute in the PPD file). If the
make and model is not specified in the PPD file then the ModelName or
ShortNickName attributes are used instead.

<H3>ppd-name (name(255))</H3>

<P>The ppd-name attribute specifies the PPD filename on the server
relative to the model directory. The forward slash (/) is used to
delineate directories.

<H2>Printer Attributes</H2>

<H3>job-k-limit (integer)</H3>

<P><I>(CUPS 1.1 and higher)</I>

<P>The job-k-limit attribute specifies the maximum number of kilobytes that
may be printed by a user, including banner files. The default value of 0
specifies that there is no limit.

<H3>job-page-limit (integer)</H3>

<P><I>(CUPS 1.1 and higher)</I>

<P>The job-page-limit attribute specifies the maximum number of pages that
may be printed by a user, including banner files. The default value of 0
specifies that there is no limit.

<H3>job-quota-period (integer)</H3>

<P><I>(CUPS 1.1 and higher)</I>

<P>The job-quota-period attribute specifies the time period used for quota
calculations, in seconds. The default value of 0 specifies that the limits
apply to all jobs that have been printed by a user that are still known to
the system.

<H3>job-sheets-supported (1setof type3 keyword | name(MAX))</H3>

<P><I>(CUPS 1.1 and higher)</I>

<P>The job-sheets-supported attribute specifies the available banner files.
There will always be at least one banner file available called "none".

<H3>printer-type (type2 enum)</H3>

<P>The printer-type attribute specifies printer type and capability bits for
the printer or class. The default value is computed from internal state
information and the PPD file for the printer. The following bits are defined:

the CUPS-Get-Printers and CUPS-Get-Classes operations. The bits are defined
identically to the printer-type attribute and default to all 1's.

<H3>requesting-user-name-allowed (1setof name(127))</H3>

<P><I>(CUPS 1.1 and higher)</I>

<P>The requesting-user-name-allowed attribute lists all of the users that are

requesting-user-name-allowed attribute will be defined, but not both.

<H2>Printer Class Attributes</H2>

<H3>member-names (1setof name(127))</H3>

<P>The member-names attribute specifies each of the printer-name attributes of
the member printers and classes. Each name corresponds to the same element of
the member-uris attribute.

<H3>member-uris (1setof uri)</H3>

<P>The member-uris attribute specifies each of the printer-uri attributes of
the member printers and classes. Each URI corresponds to the same element of
the member-names attribute.
