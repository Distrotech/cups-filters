<H2><A NAME="intro">Introduction</A></H2>

The Common UNIX Printing System provides a portable printing layer for 
UNIX&reg; operating systems. It has been developed by Easy Software 
Products to promote a standard printing solution for all UNIX vendors 
and users. CUPS provides the System V and Berkeley command-line 
interfaces. 

<P>CUPS uses the Internet Printing Protocol (IETF-IPP) as the basis
for  managing print jobs and queues. The Line Printer Daemon (LPD,
RFC1179), Server Message Block (SMB), and AppSocket protocols are also
supported with reduced functionality.

<P>CUPS adds network printer browsing and PostScript Printer 
Description (&quot;PPD&quot;)-based printing options to support real
world applications under UNIX.

<P>CUPS also includes a customized version of GNU GhostScript (currently
based off GNU GhostScript 4.03) and an image file RIP that can be used to
support non-PostScript printers.

<H2><A NAME="require">Requirements</A></H2>

You'll need an ANSI C compiler to build CUPS on your system. As its name
implies, CUPS is designed to run on the UNIX operating system, however
the CUPS interface library and most of the filters and backends supplied
with CUPS should also run under Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg;.

<P>For the image file filters you'll need the JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and ZLIB
libraries.  CUPS will build without these, but with reduced functionality.

<P>If you make changes to the man pages you'll need GNU groff or another
nroff-like package.

<P>The documentation is formatted using the HTMLDOC software (again, not
needed unless you make changes.)

<H2><A NAME="compile">Compiling CUPS</A></H2>

CUPS uses GNU autoconf to configure the makefiles and source code for your
system. To configure CUPS for your system type:

<UL><PRE>
% ./configure ENTER
</PRE></UL>

The default installation will put the CUPS software in the <CODE>/usr</CODE>
and <CODE>/var</CODE> directories on your system, which will overwrite any
existing printing commands on your system. To install the CUPS software in
another location use the <CODE>--prefix</CODE> option:

<UL><PRE>
% ./configure --prefix=/usr/local ENTER
</PRE></UL>

Once you have configured things, just type:

<UL><PRE>
% make ENTER
</PRE></UL>

to build the software.

<H2><A NAME="install">Installing the Software</A></H2>

To install the software type:

<UL><PRE>
% make install ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<H2><A NAME="config">Configuring the Software</A></H2>

Before you run CUPS for the first time you'll need to edit the CUPS
configuration files which are normally located in /var/cups/conf.

<UL>

	The <CODE>cupsd.conf</CODE> file configures all of the
	"global" server settings and access control. The default
	settings are usually appropriate for most environments.

	<P>The <CODE>printers.conf</CODE> file configures each printer
	queue. You'll need to add a listing for each printer on your
	system.

	<P>The <CODE>classes.conf</CODE> file configures each printer
	class. You'll need to add a listing for each printer class you
	want.

	<P>The <CODE>mime.types</CODE> file defines all of the
	recognized file types. You don't normally have to edit this
	file.

	<P>The <CODE>mime.convs</CODE> file defines all of the file
	conversion filters. You don't normally have to edit this file.

</UL>

In addition to the files in the /var/cups/conf directory, you'll also need
to copy PPD files for each printer to the /var/cups/ppd directory.  If you
don't have a PPD file for your printer, the drivers will still work, just
with reduced functionality.

<H2><A NAME="run">Running the Software</A></H2>

Once you have configured the software you can start the CUPS daemon by
typing:

<UL><PRE>
% /usr/sbin/cupsd &amp; ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<H2><A NAME="use">Using the Software</A></H2>

Once you have installed the software, you can use the normal lp or lpr
commands to print jobs. If you installed the software under /usr then
you shouldn't have to reconfigure any applications to recognize the new
printing system.

<P>One of the advantages of CUPS is that you don't always have to send
PostScript or Text files to your printers. If you have a JPEG file, you
can just type "lp filename.jpg" and CUPS will handle converting it for
you!

<P>You can monitor the status of jobs via the lpstat command or with your
web browser by pointing it at "http://localhost:631".

<H2><A NAME="known">Known Problems</A></H2>

The following known problems are being worked on and should be resolved for
the second beta release of CUPS:

<UL>

	<LI>Documentation is not completed.

	<LI>The lpadmin command is currently not provided.

	<LI>The lpq command is currently not provided.

	<LI>The lpc command currently only supports the help and status
	commands.

	<LI>While both GNU GhostScript and the CUPS image RIP are
	provided, no sample raster printer driver is provided. The
	final release of CUPS will include a PCL printer driver.

	<LI>Automatic classing is currently not supported.

	<LI>The CUPS server should disable core dumps by filters, backends,
	and CGI programs.

	<LI>The CUPS server should increase the FD limit to the maximum
	allowed on the system.

	<LI>The CUPS server should close stdin, stdout, and stderr and
	run in the background ("daemon" mode...)

	<LI>The class and job CGIs are currently not provided.

</UL>

CUPS has been built and tested on the following operating systems:

<UL>
	<LI>Digital UNIX 4.0d
	<LI>HP-UX 10.20 and 11.0
	<LI>IRIX 5.3, 6.2, 6.5.3
	<LI>Linux (RedHat 5.2)
	<LI>Solaris 2.5.1, 2.6, 2.7 (aka 7)
</UL>

The client libraries and filters have been successfully compiled under
Microsoft Windows using Visual C++ 6.0.
