       cupsd.conf - server configuration file for cups

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The   _c_u_p_s_d_._c_o_n_f   file  configures  the  CUPS  scheduler,
       _c_u_p_s_d_(_8_).  It is normally located in the _/_e_t_c_/_c_u_p_s  direc-
       tory.

       Each  line in the file can be a configuration directive, a
       blank line, or a comment. Comment lines start with  the  #
       character.  The configuration directives are intentionally
       similar to those used by the  popular  Apache  web  server
       software and are described below.
