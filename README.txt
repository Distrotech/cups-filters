This is an official public beta release for the Common UNIX Printing
System.  Since this is a beta release, we do not recommend that you
use this software on a production system.  Instead, please use the
current 1.0.x release for your production systems.

Also, currently we are only providing source code for the beta releases.
As we approach a final production ("gold") release of CUPS 1.1 we will
provide binary distributions as well.

Please report all problems in the CUPS 1.1 beta releases to
"cups-beta@cups.org" or to the CUPS mailing list.

Thanks for using CUPS!


INTRODUCTION

The Common UNIX Printing System provides a portable printing layer for
UNIX® operating systems.  It has been developed by Easy Software
Products to promote a standard printing solution for all UNIX vendors
and users.  CUPS provides the System V and Berkeley command-line
interfaces.

CUPS uses the Internet Printing Protocol (IETF-IPP) as the basis for
managing print jobs and queues.  The Line Printer Daemon (LPD, RFC1179)
and AppSocket protocols are also supported with reduced functionality.

CUPS adds network printer browsing and PostScript Printer Description
("PPD")-based printing options to support real world applications under
UNIX.

CUPS also includes a customized version of GNU GhostScript (currently
based off GNU GhostScript 5.50) and an image file RIP that can be used
to support non-PostScript printers.

CUPS is Copyright 1993-2000 by Easy Software Products, All Rights
Reserved.  CUPS is currently licensed under the terms of the GNU
General Public License.  Please see the license file for details.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Binary distributions require a minimum of 10MB of free disk space. We
do not recommend using CUPS on a workstation with less than 32MB of RAM
or a PC with less than 16MB of RAM.

If you are installing from source you'll need an ANSI C compiler and
optionally one or more image file support libraries.  Complete source
installation instructions can be found in the CUPS System
Administrator's Manual in the files "doc/sam.html" or "doc/sam.pdf".


SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

The following operating system software is required to install one of
the binary distributions from Easy Software Products:

    - Digital UNIX (aka OSF1 aka Compaq Tru64 UNIX) 4.0 or higher
    - HP-UX 10.20 or higher
    - IRIX 5.3 or higher
    - Linux 2.0 with glibc2 or higher
    - Solaris 2.5 or higher (SPARC or Intel)


INSTALLING CUPS

We are currently distributing CUPS binary distributions in TAR format
with installation and removal scripts generated by our ESP Package
Manager (EPM) software, which is available from:

    http://www.easysw.com/epm

WARNING: Installing CUPS will overwrite your existing printing system.
Backup files are made by the installation script and restored by the
removal script, so if you experience problems you should be able to
remove the CUPS software to restore your previous configuration. 
However, Easy Software Products makes no warranty for this and will not
be liable for any lost revenues, etc.

To install the CUPS software you will need to be logged in as root
(doing an "su" is good enough).  Once you are the root user, run the
installation script with:

    ./cups.install ENTER

After asking you a few yes/no questions the CUPS software will be
installed and the scheduler will be started automatically.


READING THE DOCUMENTATION

Once you have installed the software you can access the documentation
(and a bunch of other stuff) on-line at:

    http://localhost:631

If you're having trouble getting that far, the documentation is located
in the "/usr/share/cups/doc" directory in the binary distributions, and
under the "doc" directory in the source archives.

Please read the documentation before asking questions.


SETTING UP PRINTER QUEUES USING YOUR WEB BROWSER

CUPS 1.1 includes a new web-based administration tool that allows you
to manage printers, classes, and jobs on your server.  To access the
printer administration tools open the following URL in your browser:

    http://localhost:631/admin

You will be asked for the administration password (root or any other
user in the sys/system/root group on your system) and then shown a
menu of available functions.

[note: adding, deleting, and modifying classes has not been implemented in
       beta 2]


SETTING UP PRINTER QUEUES FROM THE COMMAND-LINE

CUPS works best with PPD (PostScript Printer Description) files.  In a
pinch you can also use System V style printer interface scripts.

Six sample PPD files are provided with this distribution that utilize
the PostScript and image file RIPs and the sample EPSON and HP printer
drivers.  To add the sample DeskJet driver to the system for a printer
connected to the parallel port, use one of the following commands:

    Digital UNIX:

        /usr/lib/lpadmin -p DeskJet -m deskjet.ppd -v parallel:/dev/lp0 -E

    HP-UX:

        /usr/lib/lpadmin -p DeskJet -m deskjet.ppd -v parallel:/dev/c2t0d0_lp -E

    IRIX:

        /usr/lib/lpadmin -p DeskJet -m deskjet.ppd -v parallel:/dev/plp -E

    Linux:

        /usr/lib/lpadmin -p DeskJet -m deskjet.ppd -v parallel:/dev/lp0 -E
        /usr/lib/lpadmin -p DeskJet -m deskjet.ppd -v parallel:/dev/lp1 -E
        /usr/lib/lpadmin -p DeskJet -m deskjet.ppd -v parallel:/dev/lp2 -E

    Solaris:

        /usr/lib/lpadmin -p DeskJet -m deskjet.ppd -v parallel:/dev/bpp0 -E
        /usr/lib/lpadmin -p DeskJet -m deskjet.ppd -v parallel:/dev/ecpp0 -E

Similarly, for the other sample drivers you can use:

    Driver                      PPD File
    --------------------------  ------------
    HP DeskJet Series           deskjet.ppd
    HP LaserJet Series          laserjet.ppd
    EPSON Stylus Color Series   stcolor.ppd
    EPSON Stylus Photo Series   stphoto.ppd
    EPSON 9-pin Series          epson9.ppd [not in beta 2]
    EPSON 24-pin Series         epson24.ppd [not in beta 2]

These sample drivers provide basic printing capabilities, but generally
do not exercise the full potential of the printers or CUPS.  For
commercial printer drivers check out our ESP Print Pro software at:

    http://www.easysw.com/printpro


PRINTING FILES

CUPS provides both the System V "lp" and Berkeley "lpr" commands for
printing:

    lp filename
    lpr filename

Both the "lp" and "lpr" commands support printing options for the
driver:

    lp -omedia=A4 -oresolution=600dpi filename
    lpr -omedia=A4 -oresolution=600dpi filename

CUPS recognizes many types of images files as well as PostScript, HP-GL/2,
and text files, so you can print those files directly rather than through
an application.

If you have an application that generates output specifically for your
printer then you need to use the "-oraw" or "-l" options:

    lp -oraw filename
    lpr -l filename

This will prevent the filters from misinterpreting your print file.


REPORTING PROBLEMS

If you have problems, please send an email to cups-support@cups.org. 
Include your operating system and version, compiler and version, and
any errors or problems you've run into.  If you are running a version
of Linux, be sure to provide the Linux distribution you have, too.


OTHER RESOURCES

See the CUPS web site at "http://www.cups.org" for other site links.

You can subscribe to the CUPS mailing list by sending a message
containing "subscribe cups" to majordomo@cups.org.  This list is

software.  New releases of CUPS are announced to this list as well.
