.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIaccept\fR instructs the printing system to accept print jobs to the
specified destinations.
.LP
\fIreject\fR instructs the printing system to reject print jobs to the
specified destinations. The \fI-r\fR option sets the reason for rejecting
print jobs. If not specified the reason defaults to "Reason Unknown".
.LP
The \fI-E\fR option forces encryption when connecting to the server.
.SH COMPATIBILITY
The CUPS versions of \fIaccept\fR and \fIreject\fR may ask the user for an
access password depending on the printing system configuration.  This differs
from the System V versions which require the root user to execute these
commands.
