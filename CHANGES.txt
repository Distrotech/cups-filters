CHANGES IN CUPS v1.0.2

	- The HP-GL/2 filter didn't always scale the output
	  correctly.
	- The HP-GL/2 filter now supports changing the page size
	  automatically when the "fitplot" option is not used.
	- The cancel-job operation was expecting a resource name
	  of the form "/job/#" instead of "/jobs/#"; this
	  prevented the cancel and lprm commands from working.
	- The backends didn't log pages when files were printed
	  using the "-oraw" option.
	- The authorization code did not work with the Slackware
	  long shadow password package because its crypt() can
	  return NULL.
	- The chunking code didn't work for reading the response
	  of a POST request.
	- cupsGetPPD() now does authentication as needed.
	- The N-up code in the PostScript filter didn't work
	  with some printers (grestoreall would restore the
	  default blank page and device settings).
	- The N-up code in the PostScript filter didn't scale
	  the pages to fit within the imageable area of the
	  page.


CHANGES IN CUPS v1.0.1

	- Documentation updates.

	- Fixed a bunch of possible buffer-overflow conditions.

	- The scheduler now supports authentication using PAM.

	- Updated the Italian message file.

	- httpEncode64() didn't add an extra "=" if there was
	  only one byte in the last three-byte group.

	- Now drop any trailing character set from the locale
	  string (e.g. "en_US.ISO_8859-1" becomes "en_US")

	- Fixed "timezone" vs "tm_gmtoff" usage for BSD-based
	  operating systems.

	- Updated IPP security so that "get" operations can be
	  done from any resource name; this allows the CGIs to
	  work with printer authentication enabled so long as
	  authentication isn't turned on for the whole "site".

	- The IPP code didn't properly handle the "unsupported"
	  group; this caused problems with the HP JetDirect since
	  it doesn't seem to support the "copies" attribute.

	- The HTTP chunking code was missing a CR LF pair at the
	  end of a 0-length chunk.

	- The httpSeparate() function didn't handle embedded
	  usernames and passwords in the URI properly.

	- Doing "lpadmin -p printer -E" didn't restart printing
	  if there were pending jobs.

	- The cancel-job operation now requires either a
	  requesting-user-name attribute or an authenticated
	  username.

	- The add-printer code did not report errors if the
	  interface script or PPD file could not be renamed.

	- Request files are now created without world read
	  permissions.

	- Added a cupsLastError() function to the CUPS API to
	  retrieve the IPP error code from the last request.

	- Options are now case-insensitive.

	- The lpq command now provides 10 characters for the
	  username instead of the original (Berkeley standard)
	  7.

	- The cancel command needed a local CUPS server to work
	  (or the appropriate ServerName in cupsd.conf)

	- The cancel and lprm commands didn't report the IPP
	  error if the job could not be cancelled.

	- The lp and lpr commands didn't intercept SIGTERM to
	  remove temporary files when printing from stdin.

	- The lp and lpr commands didn't report the IPP error if
	  the job could not be printed.
