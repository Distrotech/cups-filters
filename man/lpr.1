     llllpppprrrr submits files for printing. Files named on  the  command
     line  are  sent  to the named printer (or the system default
     destination if no destination is specified). If no files are
     listed on the command-line llllpppprrrr reads the print file from the
     standard input.

     The following options are recognized by llllpppprrrr:

     -P _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n
          Prints files to the named printer.

     -# _c_o_p_i_e_s
          Sets the number of copies to print from 1 to 100.

     -C _n_a_m_e
          Sets the job name.

     -J _n_a_m_e
          Sets the job name.

     -T _n_a_m_e
          Sets the job name.

     -l
          Specifies that the print file is already formatted  for
          the  destination  and should be sent without filtering.
          This option is equivalent to "-oraw".

     -o _o_p_t_i_o_n
          Sets a job option.

     -p
          Specifies that the print file should be formatted  with
          a shaded header with the date, time, job name, and page
          number. This option is  equivalent  to  "-oprettyprint"
          and is only useful when printing text files.

     -r
          Specifies that the named print files should be  deleted
          after printing them.
