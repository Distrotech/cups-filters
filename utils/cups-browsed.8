\fBcups-browsed\fP has three independently switchable functions:
.IP 1. 4
Browse Bonjour broadcasts of remote printers and create/remove local
raw queues pointing to these printers.
.IP 2. 4

.SH OPTIONS

.SH FILES
/etc/cups/cups-browsed.conf
.SH NOTES
Please take references to cups 1.6.x to include newer versions.
Similarily, cups 1.5.x is intended to encompass older versions too.
.PP
In environments with only cups 1.6.x servers and clients (plus
\fBcups-browsed\fP on either server or client or both) the function described in 1.
enables the automatic discovery of remote queues and their display in
printing dialogues of applications and with command line tools.
.PP
The facility provided by 3. means that servers running cups 1.6.x plus
\fBcups-browsed\fP can broadcast their local queues so that clients with cups
1.5.x get these queues automatically available. The outcome of 2. is
that clients running cups 1.6.x plus \fBcups-browsed\fP can use the CUPS
broadcasts from servers with cups 1.5.x. As with browsing of Bonjour
broadcasts, the created local raw queues are available to applications
and command line tools.
