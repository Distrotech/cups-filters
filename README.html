<H2><A NAME="intro">Introduction</A></H2>

The Common UNIX Printing System provides a portable printing layer for 
UNIX&reg; operating systems. It has been developed by Easy Software 
Products to promote a standard printing solution for all UNIX vendors 
and users. CUPS provides the System V and Berkeley command-line 
interfaces. 

<P>CUPS uses the Internet Printing Protocol (IETF-IPP) as the basis
for  managing print jobs and queues. The Line Printer Daemon (LPD,
RFC1179), Server Message Block (SMB), and AppSocket protocols are also
supported with reduced functionality.

<P>CUPS adds network printer browsing and PostScript Printer 
Description (&quot;PPD&quot;)-based printing options to support real
world applications under UNIX.

<P>CUPS also includes a customized version of GNU GhostScript (currently
based off GNU GhostScript 4.03) and an image file RIP that can be used to
support non-PostScript printers.

<H2><A NAME="require">Requirements</A></H2>

You'll need an ANSI C compiler to build CUPS on your system. As its name
implies, CUPS is designed to run on the UNIX operating system, however
the CUPS interface library and most of the filters and backends supplied
with CUPS should also run under Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg;.

<P>For the image file filters you'll need the JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and ZLIB
libraries.  CUPS will build without these, but with reduced functionality.

<P>If you make changes to the man pages you'll need GNU groff or another
nroff-like package.

<P>The documentation is formatted using the HTMLDOC software (again, not
needed unless you make changes.)

<H2><A NAME="use">Using CUPS</A></H2>

<P>Pre-compiled binary distributions are available for CUPS from our
web site at
<A HREF="http://www.cups.org/software.html">http://www.cups.org/software.html</A>.
If you'd like to build CUPS from the source, please read the Software
Administrator's Manual.

<P>Once you have installed CUPS, the Software Administrator's Manual and
Software User's Manual are excellent places to start setting things up. 

<H2><A NAME="known">Known Problems</A></H2>

The following known problems are being worked on and should be resolved for
the fourth beta release of CUPS:

<UL>

	<LI>Documentation is not completed.

	<LI>The lpc command currently only supports the help and status
	commands.

</UL>

CUPS has been built and tested on the following operating systems:

<UL>
	<LI>Digital UNIX 4.0d
	<LI>HP-UX 10.20 and 11.0
	<LI>IRIX 5.3, 6.2, 6.5.3
	<LI>Linux (RedHat 5.2)
	<LI>Solaris 2.5.1, 2.6, 2.7 (aka 7)
</UL>

The client libraries and filters have been successfully compiled under
Microsoft Windows using Visual C++ 6.0.
