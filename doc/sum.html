 This software users manual describes how to use the Common UNIX 
Printing System (&quot;CUPS&quot;) Version 1.0.0. 
<H2><A NAME=1_1>System Overview</A></H2>
 The Common UNIX Printing System provides a portable printing layer for 
 UNIX&reg; operating systems. It has been developed by Easy Software 
 Products to promote a standard printing solution for all UNIX vendors 
 and users. CUPS provides the System V and Berkeley command-line 
interfaces. 
<P>CUPS uses the Internet Printing Protocol (IETF-IPP) as the basis for 
managing print jobs and queues. The Line Printer Daemon (LPD, RFC1179), 
Server Message Block (SMB), and AppSocket protocols are also supported 
with reduced functionality. </P>
<P>CUPS adds network printer browsing and PostScript Printer 
Description (&quot;PPD&quot;)-based printing options to support real world 
applications under UNIX. </P>

<H1 ALIGN=RIGHT><A NAME=2>1 - Printing System Overview</A></H1>
<P>This chapter provides an overview of how the Common UNIX Printing 
System works. </P>
<H2><A NAME=2_1>The Printing Problem</A></H2>
<P>For years <I>the printing problem</I> has plagued UNIX&reg;. Unlike 
Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; or MacOS, UNIX has no standard interface or system 
in place for supporting printers. Among the solutions previously 
available, the Berkeley and System V printing systems are the most 
prevalent. </P>
<P>These printing systems support line printers (text only) or 
PostScript printers (text and graphics), and with some coaxing they can 
be made to support a full range of printers and file formats. However, 
because each varient of the UNIX operating system uses a different 
printing system than the next, developing printer drivers for a wide 
range of printers is extremely difficult. That combined with the 
limited volume of customers for each UNIX varient has forced most 
printer vendors to give up supporting UNIX entirely. </P>
<P>The Common UNIX Printing System, or CUPS, is designed to eliminate <I>
the printing problem</I>. One common printing system can be used by all 
UNIX varients to support the printing needs of users. Printer vendors 
can use its modular filter interface to develop a single driver program 
that supports a wide range of file formats with little or no effort. 
 Since CUPS provides both the System V and Berkeley printing commands, 
users (and applications) can reap the benefits of this new technology 
with no changes. </P>
<H2><A NAME=2_2>The Technology</A></H2>
<P>CUPS is based upon an emerging Internet standard called the Internet 
Printing Protocol, or IPP. IPP has been embraced by dozens of printer 
and printer server manufacturers, and will be supported by the next 
Microsoft Windows operating system. </P>
<P>IPP defines a standard protocol for printing as well as managing 
print jobs and printer options like media size, resolution, and so 
forth. Like all IP-based protocols, IPP can be used locally or over the 
Internet to printers hundreds or thousands of miles away. Unlike other 
protocols, however, IPP also supports access control, authentication, 
and encryption, making it a much more secure printing solution than 
older ones. </P>
<P>IPP is layered on top of the Hyper-Text Transport Protocol, or HTTP, 
which is the basis of web servers on the Internet. This allows the user 
to view documentation and status information on a printer or server 
using their web browser. </P>
<P>CUPS provides a complete IPP/1.0-based printing system that provides 
Basic authentication and domain or IP-based access control. Digest 
authentication and TLS encryption will be available in future versions 
of CUPS. </P>
<H2><A NAME=2_3>Filters</A></H2>
<P>Filters allow a user or application to print many types of files 
without extra effort. Print jobs sent to a CUPS server are filtered 
before sending them to a printer. Some filters convert job files to 
different formats that the printer can understand. Others perform page 
selection and ordering tasks. <I>Backend</I> filters perform the most 
important task of all - they send the filtered print data to the 
printer. </P>
<P>CUPS provides filters for printing many types of image files, 
HP-GL/2 files, PDF files, and text files. CUPS also supplies PostScript 
and image file Raster Image Processors, or RIPs, that convert 
PostScript or image files into bitmaps that can be sent to a raster 
printer. </P>
<P>CUPS provides backends for printing over parallel and serial ports, 
and over the network via the JetDirect (AppSocket), Server Message 
Block, and Line Printer Daemon protocols. </P>
<H2><A NAME=2_4>Printer Drivers</A></H2>
<P>Printer drivers in CUPS consist of one of more filters specific to a 
printer. CUPS includes a sample printer driver for Hewlett-Packard 
LaserJet and DeskJet printers. While this driver does not generate 
optimal output for different printer models, it does demonstrate how 
you can write your own printer drivers and incorporate them into CUPS. </P>
