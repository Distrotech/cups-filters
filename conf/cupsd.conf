# This is the CUPS configuration file.  If you are familiar with       #
# Apache or any of the other popular web servers, we've followed the   #
# same format.  Any configuration variable used here has the same      #
# semantics as the corresponding variable in Apache.  If we need       #
# different functionality then a different name is used to avoid       #
# confusion...                                                         #

#
# Ports/addresses that we listen to.  The default port 631 is reserved
# for the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) and is what we use here.
#
# You can have multiple Port/Listen lines to listen to more than one
# port or address, or to restrict access:
#
#    Port 80
#    Port 631
#    Listen hostname
#    Listen hostname:80
#    Listen hostname:631
#    Listen 1.2.3.4
#    Listen 1.2.3.4:631
# 

#Port 80
Port 631

#
# User/Group: the user and group the server runs under.  Normally this
# must be lp and sys, however you can configure things for another user
# or group as needed.
#
# Note: the server must be run initially as root to support the
# default IPP port of 631.  It'll change users after it reads the
# configuration files and starts things up...
#

User lp
Group sys

#
# SystemGroup: the group name for "System" (printer administration)
# access.
#

SystemGroup sys

#
# ServerName: the hostname of your server, as advertised to the world.
# By default CUPS will use the hostname of the system.
#

#ServerName myhost.domain.com

#
# ServerAdmin: the email address to send all complaints/problems to.
#

ServerAdmin webmaster@your.domain.com

#
# ServerRoot: the root directory for the scheduler.
#

ServerRoot /var/spool/cups

#
# AccessLog: the access log file; if this does not start with a leading /
# then it is assumed to be relative to ServerRoot.
#

AccessLog logs/access_log

#
# ErrorLog: the error log file; if this does not start with a leading /
# then it is assumed to be relative to ServerRoot.
#

ErrorLog logs/error_log

# LogLevel: controls the number of messages logged to the ErrorLog
# file and can be one of the following:
#
#     debug	Log everything.
#     info      Log all requests and state changes.
#     warn      Log errors and warnings.
#     error     Log only errors.
#     none      Log nothing.
#

LogLevel warn

#
# HostNameLookups: whether or not to do lookups on IP addresses to get a
# fully-qualified hostname.  This defaults to Off for performance reasons...
#

#HostNameLookups On

#
# Timeout: the timeout before requests time out.
#

Timeout 300

#
# KeepAlive: whether or not to support the Keep-Alive connection
# option.
#

KeepAlive On

#
# KeepAliveTimeout: the timeout before Keep-Alive connections are
# automatically closed.
#

KeepAliveTimeout 30

#
# ImplicitClasses: whether or not to use implicit classes.
#
# Printer classes can be specified explicitly in the classes.conf
# file, or implicitly based upon the printers available on the LAN.
# When ImplicitClasses is On, printers on the LAN with the same name
# (e.g. Acme-LaserPrint-1000) will be put into a class with the same
# name. This allows you to setup multiple redundant queues on a LAN
# without a lot of administrative difficulties.  If a user sends a
# job to Acme-LaserPrint-1000, the job will go to the first available
# queue.
#

ImplicitClasses On

#
# Browsing: whether or not to broadcast printer information to
# other CUPS servers.
#

Browsing On

#
# BrowseInterval: the time between browsing updates in seconds.
#

BrowseInterval 60

#
# BrowseTimeout: the timeout for network printers - if we don't
# get an update within this time the printer will be removed
# from the printer list.  This number definitely should not be
# less the BrowseInterval value.
#

BrowseTimeout 300

#
# BrowsePort: the port used for UDP broadcasts.  By default this is
# the IPP port; if you change this you need to do it on all servers.
# Only one BrowsePort is recognized.
#

BrowsePort 631

#
# BrowseAddress: specifies a broadcast address to be used.  By
# default browsing information is broadcast to all active interfaces.
#

#BrowseAddress 192.0.2.255

#
# DocumentRoot: the root directory for HTTP documents that are served.
#

DocumentRoot /usr/share/cups/docs

#
# DefaultLanguage: the default language if not specified by the browser.
# If not specified, the current locale is used.
#

#DefaultLanguage en

#
# DefaultCharset: the default character set to use. If not specified,
# defaults to iso-8859-1.  Note that this can also be overridden in
# HTML documents...
#

#DefaultCharset iso-8859-1

#
# Access permissions for each directory served by the scheduler.
# Locations are relative to DocumentRoot...
#
# AuthType: the authorization to use; currently only "Basic" authorization is
# supported.
#
# AuthClass: the authorization class; currently only "Anonymous", "User",
# "System" (valid user belonging to group SystemGroupName), and "Group"
# (valid user belonging to the specified group) are supported.
#
# AuthGroupName: the group name for "Group" authorization.
#
# Order: the order of Allow/Deny processing.
#
# Allow: allows access from the specified hostname, domain, IP address, or
# network.
#
# Deny: denies access from the specified hostname, domain, IP address, or
# network.
