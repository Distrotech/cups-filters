.TH cups-lpd 8 "Common UNIX Printing System" "10 May 2000" "Easy Software Products"
.SH NAME
cups-lpd \- receive print jobs and report printer status to lpd clients
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cups-lpd
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcups-lpd\fR is the CUPS Line Printer Daemon ("LPD") mini-server that
supports legacy client systems that use the LPD protocol.
\fBcups-lpd\fR does not act as a standalone network daemon but instead
operates using the Internet "super-server" \fBinetd(8)\fR. Add the
following line to the \fBinetd.conf\fR file to enable the
\fBcups-lpd\fR daemon:
.br
.nf

printer stream tcp nowait lp /usr/lib/cups/daemon/cups-lpd cups-lpd
.fi
.SH COMPATIBILITY
\fBcups-lpd\fR does not enforce the restricted source port number specified
in RFC 1179, as using restricted ports does not prevent determined users
from submitting print jobs. While this behavior is different than standard
Berkeley LPD implementations, it should not affect normal client operations.
.LP
The output of the status requests follows RFC 2569, Mapping between
LPD and IPP Protocols. Since many LPD implementations stray from this
definition, remote status reporting to LPD clients may be unreliable.
