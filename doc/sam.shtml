<H1 ALIGN=RIGHT>2 - Building and Installing CUPS</H1>

<P>This chapter shows how to build and install the Common UNIX Printing System.
If you are installing a binary distribution from the CUPS web site, proceed to
the section titled, <A HREF="#BINARY">Installing a Binary Distribution</A>.

<H2>Installing a Source Distribution</H2>

<H3><A NAME="REQUIREMENTS">Requirements</A></H3>

<P>You'll need an ANSI-compliant C compiler to build CUPS on your
system. As its name implies, CUPS is designed to run on the UNIX
operating system, however the CUPS interface library and most of the
filters and backends supplied with CUPS should also compiled and run under
Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg;.

<P>For the image file filters and PostScript RIP, you'll need the JPEG,
PNG, TIFF, and ZLIB libraries. CUPS will build without these, but with
significantly reduced functionality. Easy Software Products maintains a
mirror of the current versions of these libraries at:

<UL><PRE>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.easysw.com/pub/libraries">ftp://ftp.easysw.com/pub/libraries</A>
</PRE></UL>

<P>If you make changes to the man pages you'll need GNU groff or another
nroff-like package. GNU groff is available from:

<UL><PRE>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/groff">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/groff</A>
</PRE></UL>

<P>The documentation is formatted using the HTMLDOC software. If you need to
make changes you can get the HTMLDOC software from:

<UL><PRE>
<A HREF="http://www.easysw.com/htmldoc">http://www.easysw.com/htmldoc</A>
</PRE></UL>

<H3><A NAME="COMPILING">Compiling CUPS</A></H3>

<P>CUPS uses GNU autoconf to configure the makefiles and source code
for your system. To configure CUPS for your system type:

<UL><PRE>
% ./configure ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>The default installation will put the CUPS software in the
<VAR>/etc</VAR>, <VAR>/usr</VAR>, and <VAR>/var</VAR> directories
on your system, which will overwrite any existing printing commands on
your system. To install the CUPS software in another location use the
<CODE>--prefix</CODE> option:

<UL><PRE>
% ./configure --prefix=/usr/local ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>If the PNG, JPEG, TIFF, and ZLIB libraries are not installed in a
system default location (typically <VAR>/usr/include</VAR> and
<VAR>/usr/lib</VAR>) you'll need to set the <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> and
<CODE>LDFLAGS</CODE> environment variables prior to running configure:

<UL><PRE>
% setenv CFLAGS "-I/some/directory"
% setenv LDFLAGS "-L/some/directory"
% ./configure ... ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>Once you have configured things, just type:

<UL><PRE>
% make ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>to build the software.

<H3><A NAME="INSTALLING">Installing the Software</A></H3>

<P>To install the software type:

<UL><PRE>
% make install ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<H3><A NAME="RUNNING">Running the Software</A></A></H3>

<P>Once you have installed the software you can start the CUPS daemon by
typing:

<UL><PRE>
% /usr/sbin/cupsd ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<H2><A NAME="BINARY">Installing a Binary Distribution</A></H2>

<P>CUPS comes in a variety of binary distribution formats. Easy
Software Products provides binaries in TAR format with installation and
removal scripts ("portable" distributions), and in RPM and DPKG formats
for Red Hat and Debian-based distributions.  Portable distributions are
available for all platforms, while the RPM and DPKG distributions are
only available for Linux.

<BLOCKQUOTE>

	<B>WARNING:</B>
	
	<P>Installing CUPS will overwrite your existing printing
	system. If you experience difficulties with the CUPS software
	and need to go back to your old printing system, you will need
	to remove the CUPS software with the provided script and/or
	reinstall the printing system from your operating system CDs.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="PORTABLE-BINARY">Installing a Portable Distribution</A></H3>

<P>To install the CUPS software from a portable distribution you will
need to be logged in as root; doing an "su" is good enough. Once you
are the root user, run the installation script with:

<UL><PRE>
./cups.install ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>After asking you a few yes/no questions the CUPS software will be
installed and the scheduler will be started automatically.

<H3><A NAME="RPM-BINARY">Installing an RPM Distribution</A></H3>

<P>To install the CUPS software from an RPM distribution you will
need to be logged in as root; doing an "su" is good enough. Once you
are the root user, run RPM with:

<UL><PRE>
rpm -e lpr
rpm -i cups-1.1-linux-M.m.n-intel.rpm ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>After a short delay the CUPS software will be
installed and the scheduler will be started automatically.

<H3><A NAME="DPKG-BINARY">Installing an Debian Distribution</A></H3>

<P>To install the CUPS software from a Debian distribution you will
need to be logged in as root; doing an "su" is good enough. Once you
are the root user, run dpkg with:

<UL><PRE>
dpkg -i cups-1.1-linux-M.m.n-intel.deb ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>After a short delay the CUPS software will be installed and the
scheduler will be started automatically.

<H1 ALIGN="RIGHT">3 - Getting Started</H1>

<P>This chapter describes how to add your first printer.

<H2>The Basics</H2>

<P>CUPS provides two methods for adding printers - a command-line
program called <CODE>lpadmin</CODE> and a WWW interface. The
<CODE>lpadmin</CODE> command allows you to perform most printer
administration tasks from the command-line and is located in
<VAR>/usr/sbin</VAR>. The WWW interface is located at
<A HREF="http://localhost:631/admin">http://localhost:631/admin</A> and
will step you through printer configuration. If you don't like
command-line interfaces, try the WWW interface instead.

<P>Each printer queue has a name associated with it; the printer name is a
string of up to 127 letters, numbers, and the underscore (_) that starts with
a letter. Case is not significant, e.g. PRINTER and printer are considered to
be the same name.

<P>Printer queues also have a device associated with them. The device can be
a parallel port, a network interface, and so forth. Devices within CUPS use
Uniform Resource Identifiers ("URIs") which are a more general form of
Uniform Resource Locators ("URLs") that are used in your web browser. For
example, the first parallel port in Linux uses a device URI of
<CODE>parallel:/dev/lp1</CODE>.

<P>Finally, printer queues usually have a PostScript Printer Description
("PPD") file associated with them. PPD files describe the capabilities of
each printer, the page sizes supported, etc., and are used for PostScript
and non-PostScript printers. CUPS includes PPD files for HP LaserJet, HP
DeskJet, EPSON 9-pin, EPSON 24-pin, and EPSON Stylus printers.

<H2>Adding Your First Printer</H2>




<H2>Adding and Modifying Printers</H2>

<P>To add a printer to CUPS you simply run the <CODE>lpadmin</CODE> command
with the "-p" option:

<UL><PRE>
% /usr/lib/lpadmin -p<I>printer</I> -E -v<I>device</I> -P<I>ppd</I> ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>Spaces between the option letter and value are optional.

<P>The <I>printer</I> name can be up to 127 letters, digits, hyphens,
and underscores. Unlike other printing systems, the printer name in
CUPS is <I>not</I> case-sensitive, so you can't add two printers named
<CODE>LaserJet</CODE> and <CODE>laserjet</CODE>.

<P>The <I>device</I> argument specifies the device URI or filename for the
printer. The following devices are supported in a basic installation of
CUPS:

<DL>

	<DT>file:/dev/filename
	<DT>/dev/filename
	<DD>Sends all output to the specified file.

	<DT>http://[username:password@]hostname[:port]/resource
	<DT>ipp://[username:password@]hostname[:port]/resource
	<DD>Sends all output to the specified IPP printer or server.
	The <I>port</I> parameters defaults to 631.

	<DT>lpd://hostname/queue
	<DD>Sends all output to the specified LPD printer queue.

	<DT>parallel:/dev/filename
	<DD>Sends all output to the specified parallel port device.

	<DT>serial:/dev/filename[?options]
	<DD>Sends all output to the specified serial port device.  The
	<I>options</I> can be any of the following separated by the
	plus (+) character:
	<UL>
		<LI><CODE>baud=<I>rate</I></CODE> - Sets the baud rate
		for the device.
		<LI><CODE>bits=<I>7 or 8</I></CODE> - Sets the number
		of data bits.
		<LI><CODE>parity=<I>even</I></CODE> - Sets even parity
		checking.
		<LI><CODE>parity=<I>odd</I></CODE> - Sets odd parity
		checking.
		<LI><CODE>parity=<I>none</I></CODE> - Turns parity
		checking off.
	</UL>

	<DT>smb://[username:password@]hostname/queue
	<DT>smb://[username:password@]workgroup/hostname/queue
	<DD>Sends all output to the specified SMB (Windows) printer queue
	using the SAMBA software.

	<DT>socket://hostname[:port]
	<DD>Sends all output to the specified printer using the
	AppSocket protocol. The <I>port</I> parameter defaults to 9100.

</DL>

<P>The <I>ppd</I> argument specifies the PostScript Printer Description file
to use for this printer. Many options (such as media size, etc.) will not
be available if you omit this part of the <CODE>lpadmin</CODE> command.

<H3><A NAME="DRIVERS">Using Standard Printer Drivers</H2>

<P>The <CODE>lpadmin</CODE> command allows you to use "standard" PPD files
and interface scripts located in the <VAR>/usr/share/cups/model</VAR>
directory with the "-m" option:

<UL><PRE>
% /usr/lib/lpadmin -p <I>printer</I> -E -v <I>device</I> -m <I>model</I> ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <I>model</I> argument specifies the name of the PPD file or interface
script. For example, to add a printer using the sample HP DeskJet series
driver connected to parallel port 1 under Linux you would use:

<UL><PRE>
% /usr/lib/lpadmin -p DeskJet -E -v parallel:/dev/lp1 -m deskjet.ppd ENTER
</PRE></UL>


<H1 ALIGN="RIGHT">4 - Managing Printers</H1>

<P>This chapter discusses how to add, modify, and delete print queues
on your system.

<H2>The lpadmin Command</H2>

<P>The <CODE>lpadmin</CODE> command allows you to perform most printer
administration tasks from the command-line. Since <CODE>lpadmin</CODE>
is also a System V printing system command, it is located in the
<VAR>/usr/lib</VAR> directory instead of a more common one like
<VAR>/usr/bin</VAR> or <VAR>/usr/sbin</VAR>.

<H2>Adding and Modifying Printers</H2>

<P>To add a printer to CUPS you simply run the <CODE>lpadmin</CODE> command
with the "-p" option:

<UL><PRE>
% /usr/lib/lpadmin -p<I>printer</I> -E -v<I>device</I> -P<I>ppd</I> ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>Spaces between the option letter and value are optional.

<P>The <I>printer</I> name can be up to 127 letters, digits, hyphens,
and underscores. Unlike other printing systems, the printer name in
CUPS is <I>not</I> case-sensitive, so you can't add two printers named
<CODE>LaserJet</CODE> and <CODE>laserjet</CODE>.

<P>The <I>device</I> argument specifies the device URI or filename for the
printer. The following devices are supported in a basic installation of
CUPS:

<DL>

	<DT>file:/dev/filename
	<DT>/dev/filename
	<DD>Sends all output to the specified file.

	<DT>http://[username:password@]hostname[:port]/resource
	<DT>ipp://[username:password@]hostname[:port]/resource
	<DD>Sends all output to the specified IPP printer or server.
	The <I>port</I> parameters defaults to 631.

	<DT>lpd://hostname/queue
	<DD>Sends all output to the specified LPD printer queue.

	<DT>parallel:/dev/filename
	<DD>Sends all output to the specified parallel port device.

	<DT>serial:/dev/filename[?options]
	<DD>Sends all output to the specified serial port device.  The
	<I>options</I> can be any of the following separated by the
	plus (+) character:
	<UL>
		<LI><CODE>baud=<I>rate</I></CODE> - Sets the baud rate
		for the device.
		<LI><CODE>bits=<I>7 or 8</I></CODE> - Sets the number
		of data bits.
		<LI><CODE>parity=<I>even</I></CODE> - Sets even parity
		checking.
		<LI><CODE>parity=<I>odd</I></CODE> - Sets odd parity
		checking.
		<LI><CODE>parity=<I>none</I></CODE> - Turns parity
		checking off.
	</UL>

	<DT>smb://[username:password@]hostname/queue
	<DT>smb://[username:password@]workgroup/hostname/queue
	<DD>Sends all output to the specified SMB (Windows) printer queue
	using the SAMBA software.

	<DT>socket://hostname[:port]
	<DD>Sends all output to the specified printer using the
	AppSocket protocol. The <I>port</I> parameter defaults to 9100.

</DL>

<P>The <I>ppd</I> argument specifies the PostScript Printer Description file
to use for this printer. Many options (such as media size, etc.) will not
be available if you omit this part of the <CODE>lpadmin</CODE> command.

<H3><A NAME="DRIVERS">Using Standard Printer Drivers</H2>

<P>The <CODE>lpadmin</CODE> command allows you to use "standard" PPD files
and interface scripts located in the <VAR>/usr/share/cups/model</VAR>
directory with the "-m" option:

<UL><PRE>
% /usr/lib/lpadmin -p <I>printer</I> -E -v <I>device</I> -m <I>model</I> ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <I>model</I> argument specifies the name of the PPD file or interface
script. For example, to add a printer using the sample HP DeskJet series
driver connected to parallel port 1 under Linux you would use:

<UL><PRE>
% /usr/lib/lpadmin -p DeskJet -E -v parallel:/dev/lp1 -m deskjet.ppd ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<H2>Removing Printers</H2>

<P>To remove a printer to CUPS you simply run the <CODE>lpadmin</CODE> command
with the "-x" option:

<UL><PRE>
% /usr/lib/lpadmin -x<I>printer</I> ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<H2>Printer Classes</H2>

<P>CUPS allows you to group similar printers in a <I>printer class</I>. When
a user sends a print job to a class, the job will be processed by the first
available printer in that class.

<P>To add a printer to a class you simply run the <CODE>lpadmin</CODE> command
with the "-p" and "-c" options:

<UL><PRE>
% /usr/lib/lpadmin -p<I>printer</I> -c<I>class</I> ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <I>class</I> is created automatically if it doesn't exist. To remove a
class just use the "-x" option:

<UL><PRE>
% /usr/lib/lpadmin -x<I>class</I> ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<H2>Setting the Default Printer</H2>

<P>To set the default printer or class simply run the <CODE>lpadmin</CODE>
command with the "-d" option:

<UL><PRE>
% /usr/lib/lpadmin -d<I>destination</I> ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <I>destination</I> argument is the name of the printer or class.

<H2>Starting and Stopping Printers</H2>

<P>The <CODE>enable</CODE> and <CODE>disable</CODE> commands start and stop
printer queues, respectively:

<UL><PRE>
% /usr/bin/enable <I>printer</I> ENTER
% /usr/bin/disable <I>printer</I> ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>Printers that are disabled may still accept jobs for printing, but won't
actually print any files until they are restarted. This is useful if the
printer malfunctions and you need time to correct the problem. Any queues
jobs are printed after the printer is enabled (started).

<H2>Accepting and Rejecting Print Jobs</H2>

<P>The <CODE>accept</CODE> and <CODE>reject</CODE> commands accept and reject
print jobs for the named printer, respectively:

<UL><PRE>
% /usr/lib/accept <I>printer</I> ENTER
% /usr/lib/reject <I>printer</I> ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>As noted above, a printer can be stopped but accepting new print
jobs. A printer can also be rejecting new print jobs while it finishes
those that have been queued. This is useful for when you must perform
maintenance on the printer and will not have it available to users for
a long period of time.


<H1 ALIGN="RIGHT">5 - Printer Classes</H1>



<H1 ALIGN="RIGHT">6 - Printing System Management</H1>

<P>This chapter shows how you can configure the CUPS server.

<H2>Changing the Configuration Files</H2>

<P>All of the server configuration files are located in the
<VAR>/etc/cups</VAR> directory. Once you have made a change to a
file you need to restart the CUPS server by sending it a HUP signal or
using the supplied script "<CODE>cups.sh</CODE>":

<UL><PRE>
% ./cups.sh restart ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>The binary distribution installs the script in the
<CODE>init.d</CODE> directory with the name <CODE>lp</CODE> or
<CODE>lpd</CODE> depending on the vendor-supplied printing system.

<H2>Temporary Files</H2>

<P>Normally CUPS puts all of its temporary files in <VAR>/var/tmp</VAR>.
If you'd like to change this directory you'll need to edit the
<VAR>/etc/cups/cupsd.conf</VAR> file.

<P>Start by creating the new temporary directory and setting the appropriate
permissions:

<UL><PRE>
% mkdir <I>/foo/bar/tmp</I> ENTER
% chmod a+rwxt <I>/foo/bar/tmp</I> ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>Then change the line containing the <CODE>TempDir</CODE> directive in
the <VAR>cupsd.conf</VAR> to the directory that you've created:

<UL><PRE>
TempDir <I>/foo/bar/tmp</I>
</PRE></UL>

<P>Finally, restart the server as outlined in the first section of this
chapter.

<H2>Network Configuration</H2>

<P>The default configuration of the CUPS server listens for connections from
all network interfaces on port 631 (the standard IPP port). Administration
functions are limited to local connections with the appropriate username and
password.

<P>If you'd like to limit access to your system you'll need to edit the
<VAR>/etc/cups/cupsd.conf</VAR> file.

<H3><A NAME="">Port</A></H3>

<P>The <CODE>Port</CODE> directive specifies a port to listen on for
all interfaces. Besides the standard IPP port (631) you can also setup
your server to listen on the HTTP port (80) to use your CUPS server as
a standard web server as well.

<H3><A NAME="">Listen</A></H3>

<P>The <CODE>Listen</CODE> directive specifies a listening address and port,
extending the functionality of the <CODE>Port</CODE> directive. If you want
to allow connections only from the local machine you can use:

<UL><PRE>
Listen 127.0.0.1:631
</PRE></UL>

<P>instead of the <CODE>Port</CODE> directive.

<P>If you want to limit access to a specific network/subnet, make sure you
specify only the network address and not your system's network address!

<H3><A NAME="">BrowsePort</A></H3>

<P>The <CODE>BrowsePort</CODE> directive controls which port is monitored for
remote printers. By default it is set to the IPP port (631), however you can
change it as needed.

<UL>

	<B>NOTE:</B>

	<P>You must set the <CODE>BrowsePort</CODE> to the same value
	on all of the systems that you want to see.

</UL>

<H3><A NAME="">BrowseAddress</A></H3>

<P>The <CODE>BrowseAddress</CODE> directive specifies a broadcast address to
use when sending printer status updates over the network. The default
browse address is <CODE>255.255.255.255</CODE> which will send printer
information to all subnets.

<UL>

	<B>NOTE:</B>

	<P>If you are using HP-UX 10.20 and a subnet that is not 24,
	16, or 8 bits, printer browsing (and in fact all broadcast
	reception) will not work. This problem appears to be fixed in
	HP-UX 11.0.

</UL>

<H2>Printer Security</H2>

<P>CUPS provides IP and domain-name based access control and Basic
authentication for authentication.

<H3><A NAME="">Location</A></H3>

<P>The <CODE>Location</CODE> directive defines access control for a
specific HTTP directory. The following pseudo directories are provided
by the CUPS server:

<UL>

	<LI><VAR>/admin</VAR> - This is the URI that must be referenced to
	do printer administation commands.

	<LI><VAR>/classes</VAR> - This is the URI that must be referenced to
	access printer classes.

	<LI><VAR>/jobs</VAR> - This is the URI that must be referenced to
	access jobs.

	<LI><VAR>/printers</VAR> - This is the URI that must be referenced to
	access printers.

</UL>

<P>All other directories are taken from the
<VAR>/usr/share/cups/doc</VAR> directory.

<P>The <CODE>Location</CODE> directive surrounds the other access control
directives described below. The default server configuration uses:

<UL><PRE>
&lt;Location /admin&gt;
AuthType Basic
AuthClass System

Order Deny,Allow
Deny From All
Allow From 127.0.0.1
&lt;/Location&gt;
</PRE></UL>

<H3><A NAME="">Order</A></H3>

<P>The <CODE>Order</CODE> directive defines the default access control.
The following values are supported:

<UL>

	<LI><CODE>Order Allow,Deny</CODE> - Allow requests from all
	systems <I>except</I> for those listed in a <CODE>Deny</CODE>
	directive.

	<LI><CODE>Order Deny,Allow</CODE> - Allow requests only from
	those listed in an <CODE>Allow</CODE> directive.

</UL>

<P>The <CODE>Order</CODE> directive must appear inside a
<CODE>Location</CODE> directive.

<H3><A NAME="">Allow</A></H3>

<P>The <CODE>Allow</CODE> directive specifies a hostname, IP address, or
network that is allowed access to the server:

<UL><PRE>
Allow from All
Allow from None
Allow from *.domain.com
Allow from .domain.com
Allow from host.domain.com
Allow from nnn.*
Allow from nnn.nnn.*
Allow from nnn.nnn.nnn.*
Allow from nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn
Allow from nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn/mm
Allow from nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn/mmm.mmm.mmm.mmm
</PRE></UL>

<P><CODE>Allow</CODE> directives are cummulative, so multiple <CODE>Allow</CODE>
directives can be used to allow access for multiple hosts or networks.  The
<CODE>/mm</CODE> notation specifies a CIDR netmask:

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="80%" BORDER="1">

<P>The <CODE>Allow</CODE> directive must appear inside a
<CODE>Location</CODE> directive.

<H3><A NAME="">Deny</A></H3>

<P>The <CODE>Deny</CODE> directive specifies a hostname, IP address, or
network that is allowed access to the server:

<UL><PRE>
Deny from All
Deny from None
Deny from *.domain.com
Deny from .domain.com
Deny from host.domain.com
Deny from nnn.*

</PRE></UL>

<P><CODE>Deny</CODE> directives are cummulative, so multiple <CODE>Deny</CODE>
directives can be used to allow access for multiple hosts or networks.  The

<P>The <CODE>Deny</CODE> directive must appear inside a
<CODE>Location</CODE> directive.

<H3><A NAME="">AuthType</A></H3>

<P>The <CODE>AuthType</CODE> directive defines the type of authentication to
perform:

<UL>

	<LI><CODE>None</CODE> - No authentication should be performed
	(default.)

	<LI><CODE>Basic</CODE> - Basic authentication should be
	performed using the UNIX password and group files.

	<LI><CODE>Digest</CODE> - Digest authentication should be
	performed using the <VAR>/etc/cups/passwd.md5</VAR> file.

</UL>

<P>The <CODE>AuthType</CODE> directive must appear inside a
<CODE>Location</CODE> directive.

<H3><A NAME="">AuthClass</A></H3>

<P>The <CODE>AuthClass</CODE> directive defines what level of <CODE>Basic</CODE>
access is required:

<UL>

	<LI><CODE>Anonymous</CODE> - No authentication should be performed
	(default.)

	<LI><CODE>User</CODE> - A valid username and password is required.

	<LI><CODE>System</CODE> - A valid username and password is
	required, and the username must belong to the "sys" group (this
	can be changed using the <CODE>SystemGroup</CODE> directive,
	below.

	<LI><CODE>Group</CODE> - A valid username and password is
	required, and the username must belong to the group named by
	the <CODE>AuthGroupName</CODE> directive.

</UL>

<P>The <CODE>AuthClass</CODE> directive must appear inside a
<CODE>Location</CODE> directive.

<H3><A NAME=""><A NAME="AuthGroupName">AuthGroupName</A></A></H3>

<P>The <CODE>AuthGroupName</CODE> directive sets the group to use for
<CODE>Group</CODE> authentication.

<P>The <CODE>AuthGroupName</CODE> directive must appear inside a
<CODE>Location</CODE> directive.

<H3><A NAME="">SystemGroup</A></H3>

<P>The <CODE>SystemGroup</CODE> directive sets the administration group used
when authenticating the <CODE>System</CODE> type. It defaults to the "sys"
group.

<H2>File Formats</H2>

<P>CUPS provides a MIME-based file typing and filtering mechanism to
convert files to a printable format for each printer. The
<CODE>mime.types</CODE> and <CODE>mime.convs</CODE> files define the
file type and filters that are available on the system.

<H3><A NAME="">mime.types</A></H3>

<P>The <CODE>mime.types</CODE> defines the known file types. Each line
of the file starts with the MIME type and may be followed by one or
more file type recognition rules. For example, the
<CODE>text/html</CODE> file type is defined as:

<UL><PRE>
text/html html htm \
          printable(0,1024) + (string(0,"&lt;HTML&gt;") string(0,"&lt;!DOCTYPE"))
</PRE></UL>

<P>The first two rules say that any file with an extension of ".html" or
".htm" is a HTML file. The third rules says that any file whose first
1024 characters are printable text and starts with the strings "&lt;HTML&gt;"
or "&lt;!DOCTYPE" is a HTML file as well.

<P>The first two rules deal solely with the name of the file being
typed. This is useful when the original filename is known, however for
print files the server doesn't always have a filename to work with. The
third rule takes care of this possibility and automatically figures out
the file type based upon the contents of the file instead.

<P>The available tests are:

<UL>

	<LI><CODE>( expr )</CODE> - Parenthesis for expression grouping

	<LI><CODE>+</CODE> - Logical AND

	<LI><CODE>,</CODE> or whitespace - Logical OR

	<LI><CODE>!</CODE> - Logical NOT

	<LI><CODE>match("pattern")</CODE> - Pattern match on filename

	<LI><CODE>extension</CODE> - Pattern match on "*.extension"

	<LI><CODE>ascii(offset,length)</CODE> - True if bytes are valid
	printable ASCII (CR, NL, TAB, BS, 32-126)

	<LI><CODE>printable(offset,length)</CODE> - True if bytes are
	printable 8-bit chars (CR, NL, TAB, BS, 32-126, 160-254)

	<LI><CODE>string(offset,"string")</CODE> - True if bytes are
	identical to string

	<LI><CODE>contains(offset,range,"string")</CODE> - True if the
	range of bytes contains the string

	<LI><CODE>char(offset,value)</CODE> - True if byte is identical

	<LI><CODE>short(offset,value)</CODE> - True if 16-bit integer
	is identical (network or "big-endian" byte order)

	<LI><CODE>int(offset,value)</CODE> - True if 32-bit integer is
	identical (network or "big-endian" byte order)

	<LI><CODE>locale("string")</CODE> - True if current locale
	matches string

</UL>

<H3><A NAME="">mime.convs</A></H3>

<P>The <CODE>mime.convs</CODE> file defines all of the filter programs that
are known to the system. Each line consists of:

<UL><PRE>
source destination cost program

text/plain application/postscript 50 texttops
application/vnd.cups-postscript application/vnd.cups-raster 50 pstoraster
image/* application/vnd.cups-postscript 50 imagetops
image/* application/vnd.cups-raster 50 imagetoraster
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <I>source</I> field is a MIME type, optionally using a wildcard for
the super-type or sub-type (e.g. "text/plain", "image/*", "*/postscript").

<P>The <I>destination</I> field is a MIME type defined in the
<CODE>mime.types</CODE> file.

<P>The <I>cost</I> field defines a relative cost for the filtering
operation from 1 to 100. The cost is used to choose between two
different sets of filters when converting a file. For example, to convert
from <CODE>image/jpeg</CODE> to <CODE>application/vnd.cups-raster</CODE>,
you could use the <CODE>imagetops</CODE> and <CODE>pstoraster</CODE>
filters for a total cost of 100, or the <CODE>imagetoraster</CODE> filter
for a total cost of 50.

<P>The <I>program</I> field defines the filter program to run; the
special program "-" can be used to make two file types equivalent. The
program must accept the standard filter arguments and environment
variables described in the CUPS Interface Design Document:

<UL><PRE>
program job user title options [filename]
</PRE></UL>

<P>If specified, the <I>filename</I> argument defines a file to read
when filtering, otherwise the filter must read from the standard input.
All filtered output must go to the standard output.

This chapter describes the CUPS log files.

<H2>Where to Find the Log Files</H2>

<P>The log files are normally stored in the <VAR>/var/log/cups</VAR>
directory. You can change this by editing the
<VAR>/etc/cups/cupsd.conf</VAR> configuration file.

<H2>The access_log File</H2>

<P>The <VAR>access_log</VAR> file lists each HTTP resource that is accessed
by a web browser or CUPS/IPP client. Each line is in the so-called "Common
Log Format" used by many web servers and web reporting tools:

<UL><PRE>
host group user date-time \"method resource version\" status bytes

127.0.0.1 - - [20/May/1999:19:20:29 +0000] "POST /admin/ HTTP/1.1" 401 0
127.0.0.1 - mike [20/May/1999:19:20:31 +0000] "POST /admin/ HTTP/1.1" 200 0
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <I>host</I> field will normally only be an IP address unless you
have changed the <CODE>HostnameLookups</CODE> directive on in the
<VAR>cupsd.conf</VAR> file.

<P>The <I>group</I> field always contains "-".

<P>The <I>user</I> field is the authenticated username of the requesting user.
If no username and password is supplied for the request then this field
contains "-".

<P>The <I>date-time</I> field is the date and time of the request in Greenwich
Mean Time (a.k.a. ZULU) and is in the format:

<UL><PRE>
[DD/MON/YYYY:HH:MM:SS +0000]
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <I>method</I> field is the HTTP method used ("GET", "PUT", "POST", etc.)

<P>The <I>resource</I> field is the filename of the requested resource.

<P>The <I>version</I> field is the HTTP specification version used by the
client. For CUPS clients this will always be "HTTP/1.1".

<P>The <I>status</I> field contains the HTTP result status of the
request. Usually it is "200", but other HTTP status codes are possible.
For example, 401 is the "unauthorized access" status in the example
above.

<P>The <I>bytes</I> field contains the number of bytes in the request.
For POST requests the <I>bytes</I> field contains the number of bytes
of non-IPP data that is received from the client.

<H2>The error_log File</H2>

<P>The <VAR>error_log</VAR> file lists messages from the scheduler (errors,
warnings, etc.):

<UL><PRE>
level date-time message

I [20/May/1999:19:18:28 +0000] Job 1 queued on 'DeskJet' by 'mike'.
I [20/May/1999:19:21:02 +0000] Job 2 queued on 'DeskJet' by 'mike'.
I [20/May/1999:19:22:24 +0000] Job 2 was cancelled by 'mike'.
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <I>level</I> field contains the type of message:

<UL>

	<LI><CODE>E</CODE> - An error occurred.

	<LI><CODE>W</CODE> - The server was unable to perform some action.

	<LI><CODE>I</CODE> - Informational message.

	<LI><CODE>D</CODE> - Debugging message.

</UL>

<P>The <I>date-time</I> field contains the date and time of when the page
started printing. The format of this field is identical to the <I>data-time</I>
field in the <VAR>access_log</VAR> file.

<P>The <I>message</I> fields contains a free-form textual message.

<H2>The page_log File</H2>

<P>The <VAR>page_log</VAR> file lists each page that is sent to a printer.
Each line contains the following information:

<UL><PRE>
printer user job-id date-time page-number num-copies job-billing

DeskJet root 2 [20/May/1999:19:21:05 +0000] 1 0 acme-123
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <I>printer</I> field contains the name of the printer that
printed the page. If you send a job to a printer class, this field will
contain the name of the printer that was assigned the job.

<P>The <I>user</I> field contains the name of the user (the IPP
<CODE>requesting-user-name</CODE> attribute) that submitted this file for
printing.

<P>The <I>job-id</I> field contains the job number of the page being printed.
Job numbers are reset to 1 whenever the CUPS server is started, so don't depend
on this number being unique!

<P>The <I>date-time</I> field contains the date and time of when the page
started printing. The format of this field is identical to the <I>data-time</I>
field in the <VAR>access_log</VAR> file.

<P>The <I>page-number</I> and <I>num-pages</I> fields contain the page number
and number of copies being printed of that page. For printer that can not
produce copies on their own, the <I>num-pages</I> field will always be 1.

<P>The <I>job-billing</I> field contains a copy of the
<CODE>job-billing</CODE> attribute provided with the IPP
<CODE>create-job</CODE> or <CODE>print-job</CODE> requests.

<H3><A NAME="">What is SAMBA?</A></H3>

<P>In case you haven't heard of SAMBA, it is basically a software package
that allows you to configure your UNIX system as a Windows file and printer
server. It also allows you to access files and printers on a Windows system.
Like CUPS, SAMBA is free software.

<P>SAMBA version 2.0.6 is the first release of SAMBA that supports CUPS.
You can download SAMBA from:

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A HREF="http://www.samba.org">http://www.samba.org</A></P>

<H3><A NAME="">How Do I Configure SAMBA for CUPS?</A></H3>

<P>To configure SAMBA for CUPS, edit the <CODE>smb.conf</CODE> file and
replace the existing printing commands and options with the line:

<UL><PRE>
printing = cups
</PRE></UL>

<P>That's all there is to it!  Remote users will now be able to browse and
print to printers on your system.

<H3><A NAME="">How Do I Configure CUPS for SAMBA?</A></H3>

<P>To configure CUPS for SAMBA, run the following command:

<UL><PRE>
% ln -s `which smbspool` /usr/lib/cups/backend/smb ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <CODE>smbspool</CODE> program is provided with SAMBA starting with
SAMBA 2.0.6. Once you have made the link you can use the <CODE>smb</CODE>
method in the device URI for your printers:

<UL><PRE>
% lpadmin -p <I>printer</I> -v smb://<I>hostname/printer</I> ... ENTER
% lpadmin -p <I>printer</I> -v smb://<I>workgroup/hostname/printer</I> ... ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>The second form only needs to be used if the Windows system is in a
different workgroup.
