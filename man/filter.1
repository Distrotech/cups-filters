     The CUPS filter interface provides  a  standard  method  for
     adding  support  for new document types to CUPS. Each filter
     is capable of converting from one or more input  formats  to
     another  format that can either be printed directly or piped
     into another filter to get it to a printable format.

     Filters must be capable of reading from a  filename  on  the
     command-line  or from the standard input, copying stdin to a
     temporary if required by the file format.

     The command name (argv[0]) is set to the name of the  desti-
     nation printer.

     The following environment variables are defined by the  CUPS
     server when executing each filter:

     CHARSET
          The default text character set (typically  us-ascii  or
          iso-8859-1).

     CONTENT_TYPE
          The  MIME  type  associated   with   the   file   (e.g.
          application/postscript).

     DEVICE_URI
          The device-uri associated with the printer.

     LANG
          The default language locale (typically C or en).

     PATH
          The standard execution path for external programs  that
          may be run by the filter.

     PPD
          The full pathname of the PostScript Printer Description
          (PPD) file for this printer.

     PRINTER
          The name of the printer; this  is  provided  for  shell
          scripts which may not be able to get the passed argv[0]
          string.

          The recommended amount of  memory  to  use  for  Raster
          Image Processors (RIPs).

     SERVER_ROOT
          The root directory of the server.

     SOFTWARE
          The name and version number of  the  server  (typically
          CUPS/1.0).

     TZ
          The timezone of the server.

     USER
          The user executing the filter (typically lp).

     While the filter  interface  is  compatible  with  System  V
     interface  scripts,  it  will  only  work  with the System V
     interface script as the only filter.  Typically  the  inter-
     face  script  will  be  provided  via the llllppppaaaaddddmmmmiiiinnnn((((8888)))) command
     using the -_i option.
