# Directories...

# The first section uses the GNU names (which are *extremely*
# difficult to find in a makefile because they are lowercase...)
# We have to define these first because autoconf uses ${prefix}
# and ${exec_prefix} for most of the other directories...
#
# This is immediately followed by definition in ALL CAPS for the
# needed directories...
