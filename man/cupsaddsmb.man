.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIcupsaddsmb\fR exports printers to the SAMBA software (version
2.2.0 or higher) for use with Windows clients. Depending on the
SAMBA configuration, you may need to provide a password to
export the printers. This program requires the Adobe PostScript
printer driver files described below.
.LP
The \fI-H\fR option specifies the SAMBA server which defaults
to the CUPS server.
.LP
The \fI-U\fR option specifies the SAMBA print admin username which defaults
to your current username.
.LP
The \fI-a\fR option exports all known printers. Otherwise only
the named printers are exported.
.LP
The \fI-h\fR option specifies a different CUPS server to use.
.LP
The \fI-v\fR option specifies that verbose information should be
shown and is useful for debugging SAMBA configuration problems.
.SH SAMBA CONFIGURATION
\fIcupsaddsmb\fR uses the new RPC-based printing support in
SAMBA 2.2.x to provide printer drivers and PPD files to Windows
client machines. In order to use this functionality, you must
first configure SAMBA (via the smb.conf file) to support
printing through CUPS and provide a printer driver download
share, as follows:
.nf

    [global]
	load printers = yes
	printing = cups
	printcap name = cups

    [printers]
	comment = All Printers
	path = /var/spool/samba
	browseable = no
	public = yes
	guest ok = yes
	writable = no
	printable = yes
	printer admin = root

    [print$]
	comment = Printer Drivers
	path = /etc/samba/drivers
	browseable = yes
	guest ok = no
	read only = yes
	write list = root
.fi
.LP
This configuration assumes a FHS-compliant installation of
SAMBA; adjust the [printers] and [print$] share paths
accordingly on your system as needed.
.SH ADOBE POSTSCRIPT DRIVERS FOR WINDOWS
\fIcupsaddsmb\fR uses the Adobe PostScript printer drivers for
Windows, which are available for download from the Adobe web
site (http://www.adobe.com). Once you have extracted the driver
files, create a "drivers" directory in the CUPS data directory
(usually /usr/share/cups) and copy the Adobe files using
UPPERCASE filenames, as follows:
.nf

    ADFONTS.MFM
    ADOBEPS4.DRV
    ADOBEPS4.HLP
    ADOBEPS5.DLL
    ADOBEPSU.DLL
    ADOBEPSU.HLP
    DEFPRTR2.PPD
    ICONLIB.DLL
    PSMON.DLL
.fi
