Abstract
   This document defines four new Job Description attributes for
   monitoring job progress to be registered as extensions to IPP/1.0
   [RFC2566] and IPP/1.1 [RFC2911].  These attributes are drawn from the
   PWG Job Monitoring MIB [rfc2707].  The new Job Description attributes
   are:

  "job-collation-type" (type2 enum)
  "sheet-completed-copy-number" (integer(0:MAX))
  "sheet-completed-document-number" (integer(0:MAX))
  "impressions-completed-current-copy" (integer(0:MAX))

   This document also defines a new "sheet-collate" Job Template
   attribute to control sheet collation and to help with the
   interpretation of the job progress attributes.  These new attributes
   may also be used by themselves in combination with the IPP/1.1 "job-
   impressions-completed" attribute as useful job progress monitoring
   attributes and/or may be passed in an IPP Notification (see [ipp-
   ntfy]).

INTERNET-DRAFT       IPP: Job Progress Attributes       January 23, 2001


   The full set of IPP documents includes:

  Design Goals for an Internet Printing Protocol [RFC2567]
  Rationale for the Structure and Model and Protocol for the Internet
     Printing Protocol [RFC2568]
  Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics [RFC2911]
  Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Encoding and Transport [RFC2910]
  Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Implementer's Guide [ipp-iig]
  Mapping between LPD and IPP Protocols [RFC2569]
  Internet Printing Protocol/1.0 & 1.1:  Event Notification
     Specification [ipp-ntfy]
   The "Design Goals for an Internet Printing Protocol" document takes a
   broad look at distributed printing functionality, and it enumerates
   real-life scenarios that help to clarify the features that need to be
   included in a printing protocol for the Internet.  It identifies
   requirements for three types of users: end users, operators, and
   administrators.  It calls out a subset of end user requirements that
   are satisfied in IPP/1.0.  A few OPTIONAL operator operations have
   been added to IPP/1.1.

   The "Rationale for the Structure and Model and Protocol for the
   Internet Printing Protocol" document describes IPP from a high level
   view, defines a roadmap for the various documents that form the suite
   of IPP specification documents, and gives background and rationale
   for the IETF working group's major decisions.

   The "Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics" document
   describes a simplified model with abstract objects, their attributes,
   and their operations that are independent of encoding and transport.
   It introduces a Printer and a Job object.  The Job object optionally
   supports multiple documents per Job.  It also addresses security,
   internationalization, and directory issues.

   The "Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Encoding and Transport" document
   is a formal mapping of the abstract operations and attributes defined
   in the model document onto HTTP/1.1 [RFC2616].  It defines the
   encoding rules for a new Internet MIME media type called
   "application/ipp".  This document also defines the rules for
   transporting over HTTP a message body whose Content-Type is
   "application/ipp".  This document defines a new scheme named 'ipp'
   for identifying IPP printers and jobs.

   The "Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Implementer's Guide" document
   gives insight and advice to implementers of IPP clients and IPP
   objects.  It is intended to help them understand IPP/1.1 and some of
   the considerations that may assist them in the design of their client
   and/or IPP object implementations.  For example, a typical order of
   processing requests is given, including error checking.  Motivation
   for some of the specification decisions is also included.

   The "Mapping between LPD and IPP Protocols" document gives some
   advice to implementers of gateways between IPP and LPD (Line Printer
   Daemon) implementations.

   The "Event Notification Specification" document defines OPTIONAL
   operations that allow a client to subscribe to printing related
   events.  Subscriptions include "Per-Job subscriptions" and "Per-
   Printer subscriptions".  Subscriptions are modeled as Subscription
   objects.  Four other operations are defined for subscription objects:
   get attributes, get subscriptions, renew a subscription, and cancel a
   subscription.

   This attribute specifies whether or not the media sheets of each copy
   of each printed document in a job are to be in sequence, when
   multiple copies of the document are specified by the 'copies'
   attribute.

   Standard keyword values are:

     'uncollated':  each print-stream sheet is printed a number of times
       in succession equal to the value of the 'copies' attribute,
       followed by the next print-stream sheet.

     'collated':  each copy of each document is printed with the print-
       stream sheets in sequence, followed by the next document copy.

   For example, suppose a document produces two media sheets as output,
   and "copies" is equal to '6',  For the 'uncollated' case, six copies
   of the first media sheet are printed followed by six copies of the
   second media sheet.  For the 'collated' case, one copy of each of the
   six sheets are printed followed by another copy of each of the six
   media sheets.

   Whether the effect of sheet collation is achieved by placing copies
   of a document in multiple output bins or in the same output bin with
   implementation defined document separation is implementation
   dependent.  Also whether it is achieved by making multiple passes
   over the job or by using an output sorter is implementation
   dependent.

   Note:  IPP/1.0 [RFC2566] and IPP/1.1 [RFC2911] is silent on whether
   or not sheets within documents are collated.  The "sheet-collate-
   supported" Printer attribute permits a Printer object to indicate
   whether or not it collates sheets with each document and whether it
   allows the client to control sheet collation.  An implementation is

   able to indicate that it supports uncollated sheets, collated sheets,
   or both, using the 'uncollated', 'collated', or both 'uncollated' and
   'collated' values, respectively.

   This attribute is affected by "multiple-document-handling."  The
   "multiple-document-handling" attribute describes the collation of
   documents, and the "sheet-collate" attribute describes the semantics
   of collating individual pages within a document.  To better explain
   the interaction between these two attributes the term "set" is
   introduced.  A "set" is a logical boundary between the delivered
   media sheets of a printed job.  For-example, in the case of a ten
   page single document with collated pages and a request for 50 copies,
   each of the 50 printed copies of the document constitutes a "set."
   In the above example if the pages were uncollated, then 50 copies of
   each of the individual pages within the document would represent each
   "set".

   The following table describes the interaction of "sheet-collate" with
   multiple document handling.

     "sheet-collate" attribute, is 'collated.'  The semantics of
     "multiple-document-handling" are otherwise nonsensical in the case
     of separate documents.



2  IPP Job Description attributes for monitoring Job Progress

   The following IPP Job Description attributes are proposed to be added
   to IPP through the type2 registration procedures.  They are useful
   for monitoring the progress of a job.  They are also used at
   attributes in the notification content in a notification report [ipp-
   ntfy].

   There are a number of Job Description attributes for monitoring the
   progress of a job.  These objects and attributes count the number of
   K octets, impressions, sheets, and pages requested or completed.  For
   impressions and sheets, "completed" means stacked, unless the
   implementation is unable to detect when each sheet is stacked, in
   which case stacked is approximated when processing of each sheet
   completes.  There are objects and attributes for the overall job and
   for the current copy of the document currently being stacked.  For
   the latter, the rate at which the various objects and attributes
   count depends on the sheet and document collation of the job.

   Consider the following four Job Description attributes that are used
   to monitor the progress of a job's impressions:

     1."job-impressions-completed" - counts the total number of
       impressions stacked for the job (see [RFC2911] section 4.3.18.2)

     2."impressions-completed-current-copy" - counts the number of
       impressions stacked for the current document copy

     3."sheet-completed-copy-number" - identifies the number of the
       copy for the current document being stacked where the first copy
       is 1.

     4."sheet-completed-document-number" - identifies the current
       document within the job that is being stacked where the first
       document in a job is 1.  NOTE: this attribute SHOULD NOT be
       implemented for implementations that only support one document
       per job.

   For each of the three types of job collation, a job with three copies
   of two documents (1, 2), where each document consists of 3
   impressions, the four variables have the following values as each
   sheet is stacked for one-sided printing:

2.1 job-collation-type (type2 enum)

   Job Collation includes sheet collation and document collation.  Sheet
   collation is defined to be the ordering of sheets within a document
   copy.  Document collation is defined to be ordering of document
   copies within a multi-document job.  The value of the "job-collation-
   type" is affected by the value of the "sheet-collate" Job Template
   attribute (see section 1.1), if supplied and supported.

   The Standard enum values are:

      '1' 'other':  not one of the defined values

      '2' 'unknown':  the collation type is unknown

      '3' 'uncollated-sheets':  No collation of the sheets within each
                  document copy, i.e., each sheet of a document that is
                  to produce multiple copies is replicated before the
                  next sheet in the document is processed and stacked.

                  If the device has an output bin collator, the
                  'uncollated-sheets(3)' value may actually produce
                  collated sheets as far as the user is concerned (in
                  the output bins).  However, when the job collation is
                  the 'uncollated-sheets(3)' value, job progress is
                  indistinguishable to a monitoring application between
                  a device that has an output bin collator and one that
                  does not.

      '4' 'collated-documents':  Collation of the sheets within each
                  document copy is performed within the printing device
                  by making multiple passes over either the source or
                  an intermediate representation of the document.  In
                  addition, when there are multiple documents per job,
                  the i'th copy of each document is stacked before the
                  j'th copy of each document, i.e., the documents are
                  collated within each job copy.  For example, if a job
                  is submitted with documents, A and B, the job is made
                  available to the end user as: A, B, A, B, ....  The
                  'collated-documents(4)' value corresponds to the IPP
                  [RFC2911] 'separate-documents-collated-copies'
                  keyword value of the "multiple-document-handling"
                  attribute.

                  If the job's "copies" attribute is  '1' (or not
                  supplied), then the "job-collation-type" attribute is
                  defined to be '4'.


      '5' 'uncollated-documents':  Collation of the sheets within each
                  document copy is performed within the printing device
                  by making multiple passes over either the source or
                  an intermediate representation of the document.  In
                  addition, when there are multiple documents per job,
                  all copies of the first document in the job are
                  stacked before the any copied of the next document in
                  the job, i.e., the documents are uncollated within
                  the job.  For example, if a job is submitted with
                  documents, A and B, the job is mad available to the
                  end user as:  A, A, ..., B, B, ....  The 'uncollated-
                  documents(5)' value corresponds to the IPP [RFC2911]
                  'separate-documents-uncollated-copies' keyword value
                  of the "multiple-document-handling" attribute.

2.2 sheet-completed-copy-number (integer(0:MAX))

   The number of the copy being stacked for the current document.  This
   number starts at 0, is set to 1 when the first sheet of the first
   copy for each document is being stacked and is equal to n where n is
   the nth sheet stacked in the current document copy.  If the value is

   unknown, the Printer MUST return the 'unknown' out-of-band value (see
   [RFC2911] section 4.1), rather than the -2 value used in some MIBs
   [rfc2707].


2.3 sheet-completed-document-number (integer(0:MAX))

   The ordinal number of the document in the job that is currently being
   stacked.  This number starts at 0, increments to 1 when the first
   sheet of the first document in the job is being stacked, and is equal
   to n where n is the nth document in the job, starting with 1. If the
   value is unknown, the Printer MUST return the 'unknown' out-of-band
   value (see [RFC2911] section 4.1), rather than the -2 value used in
   some MIBs [rfc2707].

   Implementations that only support one document jobs SHOULD NOT
   implement this attribute.


2.4 impressions-completed-current-copy (integer(0:MAX))

   The number of impressions completed by the device for the current
   copy of the current document so far.  For printing, the impressions
   completed includes interpreting, marking, and stacking the output.
   For other types of job services, the number of impressions completed
   includes the number of impressions processed.  If the value is
   unknown, the Printer MUST return the 'unknown' out-of-band value (see
   [RFC2911] section 4.1), rather than the -2 value used in some MIBs
   [rfc2707].

   This value SHALL be reset to 0 for each document in the job and for
   each document copy.



3  Conformance Requirements

   This section summarizes the Conformance Requirements detailed in the
   definitions in this document.  In general each of the attributes
   defined in this document are OPTIONAL for a Printer to support, so
   that Printer implementers MAY implement any combination of
   attributes.



4  IANA Considerations

   This section contains the exact information for IANA to add to the
   IPP Registries according to the procedures defined in RFC 2911
   [RFC2911] section 6.
