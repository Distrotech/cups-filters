<H2>Identification</H2>

<P>This document provides an overview of the Internet Printing Protocol
("IPP") version 1.1 as implemented in the Common UNIX Printing System
("CUPS") Version 1.1.

<EMBED SRC="system-overview.shtml">

<H2>Document Overview</H2>

<P>This document is organized into the following sections:

<H1>Overview</H1>

<P>CUPS 1.1 implements IPP/1.1 and the operations and attributes
defined in the "IPP: Job and Printer Set Operations",
"IPP/1.1: Output-bin Attribute Extension", and "IPP/1.1: finishings
'fold',' trim', and 'bale' attribute values extension" specifications.

<P>CUPS also provides 12 new operations and many new attributes to
support multiple IPP printers and printer classes on a single host.

<H2>IPP URIs</H2>

<P>CUPS supports both the "http" and "ipp" method names. The following
resource names are used:

<DL>

	<DT>method://hostname:port/

	<DD>Can be used for all "get" operations.

	<DT>method://hostname:port/admin

	<DD>Used for all administrative operations.

	<DT>method://hostname:port/classes/name

	<DD>Specifies a printer class.

	<DT>method://hostname:port/jobs/id

	<DD>Specifies a job.

	<DT>method://hostname:port/printers/name

	<DD>Specifies a printer.

</DL>

<P>So a typical printer URI would be "ipp://foo.bar.com/printers/LaserJet".

<P>In addition, the CUPS server also supports normal browser access to
"method://hostname:port/admin/", "method://hostname:port/classes/",
"method://hostname:port/jobs/", and "method://hostname:port/printers/"
to view and manage resources on the server dynamically.

<H2>CUPS IPP Operations</H2>

<P>CUPS provides 12 extension operations in addition to most of the
standard IPP and registered extension operations:

<H3>device-uri (uri)</H3>

<P>The device-uri attribute specifies a unique identifier for the
device. The actual format of the device-uri string depends on the value
