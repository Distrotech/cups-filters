<h2 class='title'><a name='INTRODUCTION'>Introduction</a></h2>

<p>CUPS 1.1 implements IPP/1.1 and the operations and attributes
defined in the "IPP: Job and Printer Set Operations", "IPP/1.1:
Output-bin Attribute Extension", and "IPP/1.1: finishings
'fold',' trim', and 'bale' attribute values extension"
specifications.</p>

<p>CUPS also provides 13 new operations and many new attributes
to support multiple IPP printers and printer classes on a single
host.</p>

<h3 class='title'><a name='IPP_URIS'>IPP URIs</a></h3>

<p>CUPS supports the "http", "https", and "ipp" schemes. The
following resource names are used:</p>

<dl>

	<dt><tt>scheme://hostname:port/</tt></dt>

	<dd>Can be used for all "get" operations and for server
	subscriptions.</dd>

	<dt><tt>scheme://hostname:port/admin/</tt></dt>

	<dd>Used for all administrative operations.</dd>

	<dt><tt>scheme://hostname:port/classes/name</tt></dt>

	<dd>Specifies a printer class.</dd>

	<dt><tt>scheme://hostname:port/jobs/id</tt></dt>

	<dd>Specifies a job.</dd>

	<dt><tt>scheme://hostname:port/printers/name</tt></dt>

	<dd>Specifies a printer.</dd>

</dl>

<p>So a typical printer URI would be
"ipp://foo.bar.com/printers/LaserJet". In addition, the CUPS
server also supports normal browser access via
"http://hostname:port/" and "https://hostname:port/".</p>

<h3 class='title'><a name='IPP_OPERATIONS'>CUPS IPP Operations</a></h3>

<p>CUPS provides 14 extension operations in addition to most of the
standard IPP and registered extension operations:

<h2 class='title'><a name='ATTRIBUTES'>Attributes</a></h2>

<p>CUPS provides many extension attributes to support multiple
devices, PPD files, standard job filters, printers, and printer
classes.</p>

<h3 class='title'><a name='DEVICE_ATTRIBUTES'>Device Attributes</a></h3>

<p>Device attributes are returned by the CUPS-Get-Devices
operation and enumerate all of the available hardware devices and
network protocols that are supported by the server.</p>

<h4>device-class (type2 keyword)</h4>

<p>The device-class attribute specifies the class of device and can be
one of the following:

<ul>

	<li>"file" - a disk file.

	<li>"direct" - a parallel or fixed-rate serial data port,
	currently used for Centronics, IEEE-1284, and USB printer
	ports.

	<li>"serial" - a variable-rate serial port.

	<li>"network" - a network connection, typically via AppSocket,
	HTTP, IPP, LPD, or SMB/CIFS protocols.

</ul>

<h4>device-id (text(127))</h4>

<p>The device-id attribute specifies the IEEE-1284 device ID
string for the device.</p>

<h4>device-info (text(127))</h4>

<p>The device-info attribute specifies a human-readable string describing
the device, e.g. "Parallel Port #1".

<h4>device-make-and-model (text(127))</h4>

<p>The device-makr-and-model attribute specifies a device
identification string provided by the printer connected to the device.
If the device or printer does not support identification then this
attribute contains the string "unknown".

<h4>device-uri (uri)</h4>

<p>The device-uri attribute specifies a unique identifier for the
device. The actual format of the device-uri string depends on the value
of the device-class attribute:

<ul>

	<li>"file" - The device-uri will be of the form
	"file:///path/to/filename".

	<li>"direct" - The device-uri will be of the form
	"scheme:/dev/filename" or "scheme://vendor/identifier",
	where scheme may be "parallel" or "usb" in the current
	implementation.

	<li>"serial" - The device-uri will be of the form
	"serial:/dev/filename?baud=value+parity=value+flow=value".
	The baud value is the data rate in bits per second; the
	supported values depend on the underlying hardware.
	The parity value can be one of "none", "even", or "odd".
	The flow value can be one of "none", "soft" (XON/XOFF
	handshaking), "hard" or "rts/cts" (RTS/CTS handshaking),
	or "dtrdsr" (DTR/DSR handshaking).

	<p>The URI returned by CUPS-Get-Devices will contain the
	maximum baud rate supported by the device and the best
	type of flow control available ("soft" or "hard").

	<li>"network" - The device-uri will be of the form
	"scheme://[username:password@]hostname[:port]/[resource]",
	where scheme may be "http", "https", "ipp", "lpd", "smb", or
	"socket" in the current implementation.

	<p>The URI returned by CUPS-Get-Devices will only contain
	the scheme name ("scheme"). It is up to the client
	application to add the appropriate host and other
	information when adding a new printer.

	<p>The URI returned by Get-Printer-Attributes and
	CUPS-Get-Printers has any username and password information
	stripped; the information is still stored and used by the
	server internally to perform any needed authentication.

</ul>

<h3 class='title'><a name='JOB_TEMPLATE_ATTRIBUTES'>Job Template Attributes</a></h3>

<h4>blackplot (boolean)</h4>

<p>The blackplot attribute specifies whether HP-GL/2 plot files should be
rendered entirely in black ink (blackplot=true) or using the colors and shades
specified in the file (blackplot=false). The default value is false.

<h4>brightness (integer(0:200))</h4>

<p>The brightness attribute specifies the overall brightness of the printed
output in percent. A brightness of 100 is normal, while 200 is twice as
bright and 50 is half as bright. The default value is 100.

<p>Brightness is applied to the Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black values using
the function "f(x) = brightness / 100 * x".

<h4>columns (integer(1:4))</h4>

<p>The columns attribute specifies the number of columns to generate when
printing text files. The default value is 1.

<h4>cpi (type2 enum)</h4>

<p>The cpi attribute specifies the number of characters per inch when
printing text files. Only the values 10, 12, and 17 are currently
supported. The default value is 10.

<h4>fitplot (boolean)</h4>

<p>The fitplot attribute specifies whether to scale HP-GL/2 plot files to
fit on the selected media (fitplot=true) or use the physical scale specified
in the plot file (fitplot=false). The default value is false.

<h4>gamma (integer(1:10000))</h4>

<p>The gamma attribute specifies the luminance correction for the output.
A value of 1000 specifies no correction, while values of 2000 and 500 will
generate lighter and darker output, respectively. The default value is
1000.

<p>Gamma is applied to the Red, Green, and Blue values (or luminance for
grayscale output) using the function "f(x) = x<SUp>(1000/gamma)</SUp>".

<h4>hue (integer(-180:180))</h4>

<p>The hue attribute specifies a color hue rotation when printing image
files. The default value is 0.

<h4>job-billing (text(MAX))<span class='info'>CUPS 1.1</span></h4>

<p>The job-billing attribute provides a text value to associate with a job
for billing purposes.

<h4>job-hold-until (keyword | name(MAX))<span class='info'>CUPS 1.1</span></h4>

<p>The job-hold-until attribute specifies a hold time. In addition to the
standard IPP/1.1 keyword names, CUPS supports name values of the form
"HH:MM" and "HH:MM:SS" that specify a hold time. The hold time is in
Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and <i>not</i> in the local time zone. If the
specified time is less than the current time, the job is held until the
next day.

<h4>job-sheets (1setof type3 keyword | name(MAX))<span class='info'>CUPS 1.1</span></h4>

<p>The job-sheets attribute specifies one or two banner files that are printed
before and after a job. The reserved value of "none" disables banner printing.
The default value is stored in the job-sheets-default attribute.

<p>If only one value is supplied, the banner file is printed before the job.
If two values are supplied, the first value is used as the starting banner
file and the second as the ending banner file.

<h4>job-originating-host-name (name(MAX))</h4>

<p><i>(CUPS 1.1.5 and higher)</i>

<p>The job-originating-host-name attribute specifies the host
from which the job was queued. The value will be the hostname or
IP address of the client depending on whether hostname
resolution is enabled.  The localhost address (127.0.0.1) is
<b>always</b> resolved to the name "localhost".

<p>This attribute is read-only.

<h4>lpi (type2 enum)</h4>

<p>The lpi attribute specifies the number of lines per inch when
printing text files. Only the values 6 and 8 are currently supported.
The default value is 6.

<h4>mirror (boolean)</h4>

<p>The mirror attribute specifies whether pages are mirrored on
