       The  CUPS backend interface provides a standard method for
       sending document files to different physical interfaces.

       Backends must be capable of reading from a filename on the
       command-line or from the standard input, copying the stan-
       dard input to a temporary file if required by the physical
       interface.

       The command name (argv[0]) is set to the device URI of the
       destination printer.

       The following environment variables  are  defined  by  the
       CUPS server when executing the backend:

       CHARSET
            The default text character set (typically us-ascii or
            iso-8859-1).

       CONTENT_TYPE
            The MIME type associated with the file (e.g. applica-
            tion/postscript).

       CUPS_DATADIR
            The directory where data files can be found.

       CUPS_SERVERROOT
            The root directory of the server.

       DEVICE_URI
            The  device-uri  associated with the printer; this is
            provided for shell scripts which may not be  able  to
            get the passed argv[0] string.

       LANG
            The default language locale (typically C or en).

       PATH
            The  standard  execution  path  for external programs
            that may be run by the backend.

       PPD
            The full pathname of the PostScript Printer  Descrip-
            tion (PPD) file for this printer.
