<h2 class='title'>Introduction</h2>

<p>The CUPS filter and backend APIs define standard exit codes
and provide access to the backchannel data stream. They are only
used when writing backends, filters, and port monitors.</p>

<h2 class='title'>General Usage</h2>

<p>The <var>&lt;cups/backend.h&gt;</var> and
<var>&lt;cups/cups.h&gt;</var> header files must be included to
use the <tt>CUPS_BACKEND_</tt> constants and
<tt>cupsBackChannel</tt> functions, respectively.</p>

<p>Programs using these functions must be linked to the CUPS
library: <var>libcups.a</var>, <var>libcups.so.2</var>,
<var>libcups.2.dylib</var>, <var>libcups_s.a</var>, or
<var>libcups2.lib</var> depending on the platform. The following
command compiles <var>myprogram.c</var> using GCC and the CUPS
library:</p>

<pre class='command'>
<kbd>gcc -o myprogram myprogram.c -lcups</kbd>
</pre>

<h2 class='title'>Compatibility</h2>

<p>All of these functions require CUPS 1.2 or higher.</p>
