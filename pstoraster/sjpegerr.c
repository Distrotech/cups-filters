 * This file exists solely to hold the rather large IJG error message string
 * table (now about 4K, and likely to grow in future releases).  The table
 * is large enough that we don't want it to be in the default data segment
 * in a 16-bit executable.
 *
 * In IJG version 5 and earlier, under Borland C, this is accomplished simply
 * by compiling this one file in "huge" memory model rather than "large".
 * The string constants will then go into a private far data segment.
 * In less brain-damaged architectures, this file is simply compiled normally,
 * and we pay only the price of one extra function call.
 *
 * In IJG version 5a and later, under Borland C, this is accomplished by making
 * each string be a separate variable that's explicitly declared "far".
 * (What a crock...)
 *
 * This must be a separate file to avoid duplicate-symbol errors, since we
 * use the IJG message code names as variables rather than as enum constants.
