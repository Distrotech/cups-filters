<h2 class='title'>Introduction</h2>

<p>The CUPS HTTP and IPP APIs provide...</p>

<h2 class='title'>General Usage</h2>

<p>The <var>&lt;cups/cups.h&gt;</var> header file must be included to
use the HTTP and IPP functions.</p>

<p>Programs using these functions must be linked to the CUPS
library: <var>libcups.a</var>, <var>libcups.so.2</var>,
<var>libcups.2.dylib</var>, <var>libcups_s.a</var>, or
<var>libcups2.lib</var> depending on the platform. The following
command compiles <var>myprogram.c</var> using GCC and the CUPS
library:</p>

<pre class='command'>
<kbd>gcc -o myprogram myprogram.c -lcups</kbd>
</pre>

<h2 class='title'>Compatibility</h2>

<p>Unless otherwise specified, the HTTP and IPP API functions
require CUPS 1.1 or higher.</p>
