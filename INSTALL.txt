INSTALL - OpenPrinting CUPS Filters v1.6.0 - 2011-08-22
-------------------------------------------------------

This file describes how to compile and install OpenPrinting CUPS
Filters from source code. For more information on OpenPrinting CUPS
Filters see the file called "README.txt".  A complete change log can
be found in "CHANGES.txt".

**** IF YOU HAVE A NON-POSTSCRIPT PRINTER AND ARE NOT       ****
**** RUNNING MAC OS X, YOU WILL ALSO NEED TO INSTALL GPL    ****
**** GHOSTSCRIPT WITH THE "cups" DRIVER AFTER YOU INSTALL   ****
**** CUPS.                                                  ****


BEFORE YOU BEGIN

    You'll need ANSI-compliant C and C++ compilers, plus a make program and
    POSIX-compliant shell (/bin/sh).  The GNU compiler tools and Bash work well
    and we have tested the current CUPS code against several versions of GCC
    with excellent results.

    The makefiles used by the project should work with most versions of make.
    We've tested them with GNU make as well as the make programs shipped by
    Compaq, HP, SGI, and Sun.  BSD users should use GNU make (gmake) since BSD
    make does not support "include".

    Besides these tools you'll want the JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and ZLIB libraries for
    image support, the CDSA, GNU TLS, or OpenSSL libraries for encryption
    support, the OpenLDAP and OpenSLP libraries for directory services support,
    and either MIT (1.6.3 or higher) or Heimdal Kerberos for Kerberos support.
    CUPS will compile and run without these, however you'll miss out on many of
    the features provided by CUPS.

    Also, please note that CUPS does not include the Ghostscript-based
    PostScript filter needed by non-PostScript printers.  You *must* download
    GPL Ghostscript separately from the CUPS web site if you want to print
    PostScript files to non-PostScript printers on operating systems other than
    Mac OS X.


COMPILING THE SUBVERSION REPOSITORY CODE

    The CUPS Subversion repository doesn't hold a copy of the pre-built
    configure script.  You'll need to run the GNU autoconf software (2.60 or
    higher) to create it:

	autoconf


CONFIGURATION

    CUPS uses GNU autoconf, so you should find the usual "configure" script in
    the main CUPS source directory.  To configure CUPS for your system, type:

	./configure

    The default installation will put the CUPS software in the "/etc", "/usr",
    and "/var" directories on your system, which will overwrite any existing
    printing commands on your system.  Use the "--prefix" option to install the
    CUPS software in another location:

	./configure --prefix=/some/directory

    To see a complete list of configuration options, use the --help option:

        ./configure --help

    If any of the dependent libraries are not installed in a system default
    location (typically "/usr/include" and "/usr/lib") you'll need to set the
    CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, DSOFLAGS, and LDFLAGS environment variables
    prior to running configure:

	setenv CFLAGS "-I/some/directory"
	setenv CPPFLAGS "-I/some/directory"
	setenv CXXFLAGS "-I/some/directory"
	setenv DSOFLAGS "-L/some/directory"
	setenv LDFLAGS "-L/some/directory"
	./configure ...

    or:

	CFLAGS="-I/some/directory" \
	CPPFLAGS="-I/some/directory" \
	CXXFLAGS="-I/some/directory" \
	DSOFLAGS="-L/some/directory" \
	LDFLAGS="-L/some/directory" \
	./configure ...

    Once you have configured things, just type:

	make ENTER

    or if you have FreeBSD, NetBSD, or OpenBSD type:

	gmake ENTER

    to build the software.


INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE

    Once you have built the software you need to install it.  The "install"
    target provides a quick way to install the software on your local system:

	make install ENTER

    or for FreeBSD, NetBSD, or OpenBSD:

	gmake install ENTER
