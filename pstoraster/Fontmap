% The Fontmap file takes lines in the following formats:
%
%     /FontName /RealFontName   [for aliases]
%     /FontName (FileName)      [for actual font files]
%
% All Type1 fonts in the "fonts" directory (usually /usr/share/cups/fonts)
% are automagically added with the names in the font files (that is, the
% font filename doesn't matter, it looks at the file header instead).
%

%
% This alias is for less-intelligent PC programs like Quark and
% Freehand which insist on using "Times" as the name for the
% "Times-Roman" font.  Go figure.
%

/Times				/Times-Roman			;
