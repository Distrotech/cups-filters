       llpprr submits files for printing. Files named on the command
       line  are sent to the named printer (or the system default
       destination if no destination is specified). If  no  files
       are  listed  on  the command-line llpprr reads the print file
       from the standard input.

       The following options are recognized by llpprr:

       -P _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n
            Prints files to the named printer.

       -# _c_o_p_i_e_s
            Sets the number of copies to print from 1 to 100.

       -C _n_a_m_e
            Sets the job name.

       -J _n_a_m_e
            Sets the job name.

       -T _n_a_m_e
            Sets the job name.

       -l
            Specifies that the print file  is  already  formatted
            for  the  destination and should be sent without fil-
            tering. This option is equivalent to "-oraw".

       -o _o_p_t_i_o_n
            Sets a job option.

       -p
            Specifies that the print  file  should  be  formatted
            with  a  shaded header with the date, time, job name,
            and  page  number.  This  option  is  equivalent   to
            "-oprettyprint" and is only useful when printing text
            files.

       -r
            Specifies  that  the  named  print  files  should  be
            deleted after printing them.
