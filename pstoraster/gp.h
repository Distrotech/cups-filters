/* Interface to platform-specific routines */
/* Requires gsmemory.h, gstypes.h */

/*
 * This file defines the interface to ***ALL*** platform-specific routines.
 * The routines are implemented in a gp_*.c file specific to each platform.
 * We try very hard to keep this list short!
 */

/* ------ Initialization/termination ------ */

/*
 * This routine is called early in the initialization.
 * It should do as little as possible.  In particular, it should not
 * do things like open display connections: that is the responsibility
 * of the display device driver.
 */

/*
 * This routine is called just before the program exits (normally or
 * abnormally).  It too should do as little as possible.

 * Exit the program.  Normally this just calls the `exit' library procedure,
 * but it does something different on a few platforms.

/* ------ Miscellaneous ------ */

/*
 * Get the string corresponding to an OS error number.
 * If no string is available, return NULL.  The caller may assume
 * the string is allocated statically and permanently.
 */

 * such as a PC; on platforms with window systems, the 'make current'
 * routines do nothing.
