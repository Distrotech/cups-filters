       mime.types - mime type description file for cups

       The _m_i_m_e_._t_y_p_e_s file defines the recognized file types.

       Additional  file  types  can  be added to _m_i_m_e_._t_y_p_e_s or in
       additional files in the configuration directory  //eettcc//ccuuppss
       with the extension ".types".

       Each  line  in the _m_i_m_e_._t_y_p_e_s file is a comment, blank, or
       rule line. Comment lines start with the # character.  Rule
       lines  start  with  the  MIME type name and are optionally
       followed by a series of file recognition  rules  that  are
       used to automatically identify print and web files:

           super/type rule [ ... ruleN]
       The  rules  may be grouped using parenthesis, joined using
       "+" for a logical AND and "," or whitespace for a  logical
       OR, and negated using "!".

RRUULLEESS
       Rules  take two forms - a filename extension by itself and
       functions with test values inside parenthesis. The follow-
       ing functions are available:

       match("pattern")
            Pattern match on filename

       ascii(offset,length)
            True if bytes are valid printable ASCII (CR, NL, TAB,
            BS, 32-126)

       printable(offset,length)
            True if bytes are printable 8-bit chars (CR, NL, TAB,
            BS, 32-126, 128-254)

       string(offset,"string")
            True if bytes are identical to string

       char(offset,value)
            True if byte is identical

       short(offset,value)
            True if 16-bit integer is identical

       int(offset,value)
            True if 32-bit integer is identical

       locale("string")
            True if current locale matches string

       contains(offset,range,"string")
            True if the range contains the string
