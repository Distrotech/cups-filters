.SH NAME
filter \- cups file conversion filter interfaces
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B filter
job user title num-copies options [
.I filename

.SH DESCRIPTION
The CUPS filter interface provides a standard method for adding support for
new document types to CUPS. Each filter is capable of converting from one
or more input formats to another format that can either be printed directly
or piped into another filter to get it to a printable format.
.LP
Filters must be capable of reading from a filename on the command-line
or from the standard input, copying the standard input to a temporary
file as required by the file format. All output must be sent to the
standard output.
.LP
The command name (argv[0]) is set to the name of the destination printer.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables are defined by the CUPS server when
executing each filter:
