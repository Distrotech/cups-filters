INSTALL - OpenPrinting CUPS Filters v1.0b2 - 2012-01-30
-------------------------------------------------------

This file describes how to compile and install OpenPrinting CUPS
Filters from source code. For more information on OpenPrinting CUPS
Filters see the file called "README.txt".  A complete change log can
be found in "CHANGES.txt".

**** IF YOU HAVE A NON-POSTSCRIPT PRINTER AND ARE NOT       ****
**** RUNNING MAC OS X, YOU WILL ALSO NEED TO INSTALL GPL    ****
**** GHOSTSCRIPT WITH THE "cups" DRIVER AFTER YOU INSTALL   ****
**** CUPS AND BEFORE YOU INSTALL THIS PACKAGE.              ****


BEFORE YOU BEGIN

    You'll need ANSI-compliant C and C++ compilers, plus a make program and
    POSIX-compliant shell (/bin/sh).  The GNU compiler tools and Bash work well
    and we have tested the current CUPS code against several versions of GCC
    with excellent results.

    The makefiles used by the project should work with most versions of make.
    We've tested them with GNU make as well as the make programs shipped by
    Compaq, HP, SGI, and Sun.  BSD users should use GNU make (gmake) since BSD
    make does not support "include".

    Poppler and libijs must be installed to be able to compile this package.

    Besides these tools you'll want the JPEG, PNG, TIFF, ZLIB libraries for
    image support. CUPS Filters will compile and run without these, however
    you'll miss out on many of the features provided by CUPS Filters.


COMPILING THE BZR REPOSITORY CODE

    The CUPS Filters BZR repository doesn't hold a copy of the pre-built
    configure script.  You'll need to run the GNU autoconf software (2.60 or
    higher) to create it:

        aclocal
	autoconf


CONFIGURATION

    CUPS Filters uses GNU autoconf, so you should find the usual "configure"
    script in the main CUPS Filters source directory.  To configure CUPS 
    Filters for your system, type:

	./configure

    The default installation will put the CUPS Filters software in the "/etc"
    and "/usr" directories on your system, which will overwrite some of the
    original filters and their auxiliary of CUPS 1.5.x or earlier. The system
    will still have the same functionality as before, but CUPS will not
    convert all incoming files into PostScript any more, it will convert them
    into PDF instead and after applying page management (N-up, selected pages,
    reverse order, ...) by the pdftopdf filter and convert PDF into the
    printer's native format then (PDF-based printing workflow). CUPS 1.6.x or
    later does not contain any filters which this package provides. It requires
    the installation of this package for printing with filters and drivers
    under Linux (or other non-Mac-OS-X operation systems).

    Use the "--prefix" option to install the CUPS Filters software in another
    location:

	./configure --prefix=/some/directory

    To see a complete list of configuration options, use the --help option:

        ./configure --help

    If any of the dependent libraries are not installed in a system default
    location (typically "/usr/include" and "/usr/lib") you'll need to set the
    CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, DSOFLAGS, and LDFLAGS environment variables
    prior to running configure:

	setenv CFLAGS "-I/some/directory"
	setenv CPPFLAGS "-I/some/directory"
	setenv CXXFLAGS "-I/some/directory"
	setenv DSOFLAGS "-L/some/directory"
	setenv LDFLAGS "-L/some/directory"
	./configure ...

    or:

	CFLAGS="-I/some/directory" \
	CPPFLAGS="-I/some/directory" \
	CXXFLAGS="-I/some/directory" \
	DSOFLAGS="-L/some/directory" \
	LDFLAGS="-L/some/directory" \
	./configure ...

    Once you have configured things, just type:

	make ENTER

    or if you have FreeBSD, NetBSD, or OpenBSD type:

	gmake ENTER

    to build the software.


INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE

    Once you have built the software you need to install it.  The "install"
    target provides a quick way to install the software on your local system:

	make install ENTER

    or for FreeBSD, NetBSD, or OpenBSD:

	gmake install ENTER
