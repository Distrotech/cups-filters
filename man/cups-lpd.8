       ccuuppss--llppdd is the CUPS Line  Printer  Daemon  ("LPD")  mini-
       server  that  supports  legacy client systems that use the
       LPD protocol.  ccuuppss--llppdd does not act as a standalone  net-
       work  daemon  but  instead  operates  using  the  Internet
       "super-server" iinneettdd((88)). Add the  following  line  to  the
       iinneettdd..ccoonnff file to enable the ccuuppss--llppdd daemon:

       printer stream tcp nowait lp /usr/lib/cups/daemon/cups-lpd cups-lpd

       ccuuppss--llppdd  does not enforce the restricted source port num-
       ber specified in RFC 1179, as using restricted ports  does
       not  prevent  determined users from submitting print jobs.
       While this behavior is different  than  standard  Berkeley
       LPD  implementations,  it  should not affect normal client
       operations.

       The output of the status requests follows RFC  2569,  Map-
       ping  between LPD and IPP Protocols. Since many LPD imple-
       mentations  stray  from  this  definition,  remote  status
       reporting to LPD clients may be unreliable.
