INTRODUCTION

CUPS provides a portable printing layer for UNIX(r)-based
operating systems.  It has been developed by Easy Software
Products to promote a standard printing solution for all UNIX
vendors and users.  CUPS provides the System V and Berkeley
command-line interfaces.

CUPS uses the Internet Printing Protocol ("IPP") as the basis
for managing print jobs and queues.  The Line Printer Daemon
("LPD") Server Message Block ("SMB"), and AppSocket (a.k.a.
JetDirect) protocols are also supported with reduced
functionality.  CUPS adds network printer browsing and
PostScript Printer Description ("PPD") based printing options to
support real-world printing under UNIX.

CUPS includes an image file RIP that supports printing of image
files to non-PostScript printers.  A customized version of GNU
Ghostscript for CUPS called ESP Ghostscript is available
separately to support printing of PostScript files within the
CUPS driver framework.  Sample drivers for Dymo, EPSON, HP, and
OKIDATA printers are included that use these filters.

Drivers for thousands of printers are provided with our ESP
Print Pro software, available at:

	http://www.easysw.com/printpro/

CUPS is licensed under the GNU General Public License and GNU
Library General Public License.  Please contact Easy Software
Products for commercial support and "binary distribution"
rights.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Binary distributions require a minimum of 10MB of free disk
space. We do not recommend using CUPS on a workstation with less
than 32MB of RAM or a PC with less than 16MB of RAM.

If you are installing from source you'll need ANSI-compliant C
and C++ compilers and optionally one or more image file support
libraries.  Complete source installation instructions can be
found in the file "INSTALL.txt".


SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

The following operating system software is required to install
one of the binary distributions from Easy Software Products:

    - AIX 4.3 or higher
    - HP-UX 11.00 or higher
    - IRIX 6.5 or higher
    - Linux 2.4 with glibc 2.2 or higher
    - Solaris 7 or higher (SPARC or Intel)


INSTALLING "PORTABLE" CUPS DISTRIBUTIONS

We are currently distributing "portable" CUPS binary
distributions in TAR format with installation and removal
scripts generated by our ESP Package Manager (EPM) software,
which is available from:

    http://www.easysw.com/epm

WARNING: Installing CUPS will overwrite your existing printing
system. Backup files are made by the installation script and
restored by the removal script, so if you experience problems
you should be able to remove the CUPS software to restore your
previous configuration.  However, Easy Software Products makes
no warranty for this and will not be liable for any lost
revenues, etc.

To install the CUPS software you will need to be logged in as
root (doing an "su" is good enough).  Once you are the root
user, run the installation script with:

    ./cups.install ENTER

After asking you a few yes/no questions the CUPS software will
be installed and the scheduler will be started automatically.


INSTALLING HOST-SPECIFIC (RPM, DEBIAN, ETC.) DISTRIBUTIONS

The host-specific distributions use the operating system
software installation tools.  To install a host-specific
distribution please consult the CUPS Software Administrators
Manual or your operating system documentation.


READING THE DOCUMENTATION

Once you have installed the software you can access the
documentation (and a bunch of other stuff) on-line at:

    http://localhost:631

If you're having trouble getting that far, the documentation is
located in the "/usr/share/doc/cups" directory in the binary
distributions, and under the "doc" directory in the source
archives.

Please read the documentation before asking questions.


GETTING SUPPORT AND OTHER RESOURCES

If you have problems, READ THE DOCUMENTATION FIRST!  We also
provide many discussion forums which are available at:

    http://www.cups.org/newsgroups.php

Commercial support (with a guaranteed response time) is available
from Easy Software Products.  For more information see:

    http://www.easysw.com/cups/

See the CUPS web site at "http://www.cups.org/" for other site
links.


SETTING UP PRINTER QUEUES USING YOUR WEB BROWSER

CUPS 1.2 includes a web-based administration tool that allows you
to manage printers, classes, and jobs on your server.  To access
the printer administration tools open the following URL in your
browser:

    http://localhost:631/admin

You will be asked for the administration password (root or any
other user in the sys/system/root group on your system) and then
shown a menu of available functions.

DO NOT use the hostname for your machine - it will not work with
the default CUPS configuration.  To enable administration access
on other addresses, consult the CUPS Software Administrators
Manual.


SETTING UP PRINTER QUEUES FROM THE COMMAND-LINE

CUPS works best with PPD (PostScript Printer Description)
files.  In a pinch you can also use System V style printer
interface scripts.

Six sample PPD files are provided with this distribution that
utilize the PostScript and image file RIPs and the sample EPSON
and HP printer drivers.  To add the sample DeskJet driver to the
system for a printer connected to the parallel port, use one of
the following commands:

    HP-UX:

        /usr/lib/lpadmin -p DeskJet -m deskjet.ppd -v parallel:/dev/c2t0d0_lp -E

    IRIX:

        /usr/lib/lpadmin -p DeskJet -m deskjet.ppd -v parallel:/dev/plp -E

    Linux:

        /usr/lib/lpadmin -p DeskJet -m deskjet.ppd -v parallel:/dev/lp0 -E
        /usr/lib/lpadmin -p DeskJet -m deskjet.ppd -v parallel:/dev/lp1 -E
        /usr/lib/lpadmin -p DeskJet -m deskjet.ppd -v parallel:/dev/lp2 -E

    Solaris:

        /usr/lib/lpadmin -p DeskJet -m deskjet.ppd -v parallel:/dev/bpp0 -E
        /usr/lib/lpadmin -p DeskJet -m deskjet.ppd -v parallel:/dev/ecpp0 -E

Similarly, for the other sample drivers you can use:

    Driver                         PPD File
    -----------------------------  ------------
    Dymo Label Printers            dymo.ppd
    EPSON Stylus Color Series      stcolor.ppd
    EPSON Stylus Photo Series      stphoto.ppd
    EPSON Stylus New Color Series  stcolor2.ppd
    EPSON Stylus New Photo Series  stphoto2.ppd
    EPSON 9-pin Series             epson9.ppd
    EPSON 24-pin Series            epson24.ppd
    HP DeskJet Series              deskjet.ppd
    HP New DeskJet Series          deskjet2.ppd
    HP LaserJet Series             laserjet.ppd
    OKIDATA 9-Pin Series           okidata9.ppd
    OKIDATA 24-Pin Series          okidat24.ppd

These sample drivers provide basic printing capabilities, but
generally do not exercise the full potential of the printers or
CUPS.  For commercial printer drivers check out our ESP Print
Pro software at:

    http://www.easysw.com/printpro/


PRINTING FILES

CUPS provides both the System V "lp" and Berkeley "lpr" commands
for printing:

    lp filename
    lpr filename

Both the "lp" and "lpr" commands support printing options for
the driver:

    lp -omedia=A4 -oresolution=600dpi filename
    lpr -omedia=A4 -oresolution=600dpi filename

CUPS recognizes many types of images files as well as PDF,
PostScript, HP-GL/2, and text files, so you can print those
files directly rather than through an application.

If you have an application that generates output specifically
for your printer then you need to use the "-oraw" or "-l"
options:

    lp -oraw filename
    lpr -l filename

This will prevent the filters from misinterpreting your print
file.
