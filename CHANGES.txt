CHANGES.txt - OpenPrinting CUPS Filters v1.0.6 - 2012-03-16
-----------------------------------------------------------

CHANGES IN V1.0.6

	- Make sure that "make clean" and "make distclean" also work if
	  Makedefs does not exist (Debian bug #663564).
	- texttopdf: A lot of internal rework; also split up into more files
	- texttopdf: Fixed many bugs on the way
	- texttopdf: Added support for CFF-flavoured OTFs; for these
          subsetting is not yet implemented, full embedding is done instead
	- texttopdf: Adapted and improved fontconfig font selection

CHANGES IN V1.0.5

	- pdftops: Added insertion of workaround PostScript code for printers
	  with bugs in their PS interpreters (Ubuntu bugs #950713, #951627).
	- parallel backend: Break infinite loop (Ubuntu bug #936647).
	- texttopdf: Complete the implementation of fontconfig-based font
	  selection (Debian bug #663070).

CHANGES IN V1.0.4

	- texttopdf: Fall back to altermative fonts via fontconfig if the
	  FreeMono TrueType fonts are not installed (Debian bugs #495598
	  and #662660).
	- bannertopdf: Fix off-by-one error in page duplication
	- bannertopdf: Put indirect references to streams into the page's
	  contents
	- bannertopdf: Let byte offsets for the Xref table of the PDF output
	  being determined correctly also when the output goes to stdout
	  (Ubuntu bug #939735).
	- bannertopdf: Output multiple copies of the test page if duplex
	  and/or N-up is chosen, to let the test page appear on all possible
	  positions of the sheet (Ubuntu bug #939530).

CHANGES IN V1.0.3

	- bannertopdf: Draw the frame to mark the non-printable borders 1pt
	  smaller all around to assure that it is always visible, like it was
	  done in bannertops.
	- bannertopdf: Scale the page to fit onto the desired output page.
	- bannertopdf: Get and output the correct media limits.

CHANGES IN V1.0.2

	- bannertopdf: Fixed crash caused by wrong Poppler API use.
	- bannertopdf: Info text on test page came out in gray and not in
	  black.

CHANGES IN V1.0.1

	- Added the textonly filter and its PPD file, a driver for text-only
	  printers.
	- Install the pdftoijs sample PPD file
	  HP-PhotoSmart_Pro_B8300-hpijs-pdftoijs.ppd
	- Added cupsfilters.drv, centralized ppdc-based PPD generator for the
	  printer driver filters in this package. Current printers supported
	  are several HP DesignJet large format inkjet printers.
	- Fixed "make uninstall". Now everything of this package gets removed.
	- Added wrapper scripts texttops and imagetops for backward
	  compatibility to third-party PPD files or custom configurations
	  which refer to these filters explicitly (Debian bug #658258).

CHANGES IN V1.0

	- Built the pdftops filter based on Ghostscript by default, as
	  Ghostscript is better optimized for print output (Ubuntu bug
	  #926068).
	- If the pdftops filter is built for using Poppler, let Poppler not
	  emit PostScript level 3, as this causes problems with some HP
	  printers (Ubuntu bug #277404, Freedesktop (Poppler) bug #19640).
	- bannertopdf needs to be linked with C++ (bug #995)
	- Added test.sh script for testing texttopdf
	- Added original documentation of the PDF filters to README.txt
	- Install C header files and the static library
	- General clean-up of "make install" targets in Makefiles
	- Raised MIME conversion cost factor of pdftoraster from 66 to 100 to
	  give priority to the gstoraster filter from Ghostscript, as this
	  filter supports ICC-profile-based color management.
	- Documentation updated because libijs, liblcms, freetype, and
          fontconfig are needed to build this package

CHANGES IN V1.0b1

	- Removed the bannertops, imagetops, and texttops filters, they are
	  not needed any more in the PDF-based printing workflow
	- Added support for liblcms2
	- Named the package "OpenPrinting CUPS Filters"
	- Renamed libcupslegacy to libcupsfilters
	- Joined pdftops and cpdftocps filters into one C program
	- Added new bannertopdf filter from Lars Uebernickel:
	  https://launchpad.net/bannertopdf
	- Added the filters for the PDF-based printing workflow, from
	  OpenPrinting: http://sourceforge.jp/projects/opfc/ and
	  http://www.openprinting.org/download/printing/pdf-printing/
	- Initial packaging of files that are no longer included in CUPS 1.6
	  from CUPS upstream (http://www.cups.org/)
