# Which protocols will we use to broadcast shared local printers to the network?
# Can use DNSSD and/or CUPS, or 'none' for neither.
# Only CUPS is actually supported, as DNSSD is done by CUPS itself (we ignore
# DNSSD in this directive).

# BrowseLocalProtocols none


# Settings of this directive apply to both BrowseRemoteProtocols and
# BrowseLocalProtocols.
# Can use DNSSD and/or CUPS and/or LDAP, or 'none' for neither.

# BrowseProtocols none


# Only browse remote printers (via DNS-SD or CUPS browsing) from
# selected servers using the "BrowseAllow", "BrowseDeny", and
# "BrowseOrder" directives

# This servers for restricting the choice of printers in print dialogs
# to trusted servers or to reduce the number of listed printers in the
# print dialogs to a more user-friendly amount in large networks with
# very many shared printers.

# This only filters the selection of remote printers for which
# cups-browsed creates local queues. If the print dialog uses other
# mechanisms to list remote printers as for example direct DNS-SD
# access, cups-browsed has no influence.

# "BrowseAllow": Accept printers from these hosts or networks. If
# there are only "BrowseAllow" lines and no "BrowseOrder" and/or
# "BrowseDeny" lines, only servers matching at last one "BrowseAllow"
# line are accepted.

# "BrowseDeny": Deny printers from these hosts or networks. If there
# are only "BrowseDeny" lines and no "BrowseOrder" and/or
# "BrowseAllow" lines, all servers NOT matching any of the
# "BrowseDeny" lines are accepted.

# "BrowseOrder": Determine the order in which "BrowseAllow" and
# "BrowseDeny" lines are applied. With "BrowseOrder Deny,Allow" in the
# beginning all servers are accepted, then the "BrowseDeny" lines are
# applied to exclude unwished servers or networks and after that the
# "BrowseAllow" lines to re-include servers or networks. With
# "BrowseOrder Allow,Deny" we start with denying all servers, then
# applying the "BrowseAllow" lines and afterwards the "BrowseDeny"
# lines.

# Default for "BrowseOrder" is "Deny.Allow" if there are both
# "BrowseAllow" and "BrowseDeny" lines.

# If there are no "Browse..." lines at all, all servers are accepted.

# BrowseAllow All
# BrowseAllow cups.example.com
# BrowseAllow 192.168.1.12
# BrowseAllow 192.168.1.0/24
# BrowseAllow 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0

# Use BrowsePoll to poll a particular CUPS server

# BrowsePoll cups.example.com
# BrowsePoll cups.example.com:631
# BrowsePoll cups.example.com:631/version=1.1


# LDAP browsing configuration
# The default value for all options is an empty string. Example configuration:

# BrowseLDAPBindDN cn=cups-browsed,dc=domain,dc=tld
# BrowseLDAPCACertFile /path/to/server/certificate.pem
# BrowseLDAPDN ou=printers,dc=domain,dc=tld
# BrowseLDAPFilter (printerLocation=/Office 1/*)
# BrowseLDAPPassword s3cret
# BrowseLDAPServer ldaps://ldap.domain.tld


# Use DomainSocket to access the local CUPS daemon via another than the
# default domain socket

# DomainSocket @CUPS_DEFAULT_DOMAINSOCKET@


# Set IPBasedDeviceURIs to "Yes" if cups-browsed should create its
# local queues with device URIs with the IP addresses instead of the
# host names of the remote servers. This mode is there for any
# problems with host name resolution in the network, especially also
# if avahi-daemon is only run for printer discovery and already
# stopped while still printing. By default this mode is turned off,
# meaning that we use URIs with host names.

# If you prefer IPv4 or IPv6 IP addresses in the URIs, you can set
# IPBasedDeviceURIs to "IPv4" to only get IPv4 IP addresses or
# IPBasedDeviceURIs to "IPv6" to only get IPv6 IP addresses.

# IPBasedDeviceURIs No
# IPBasedDeviceURIs Yes
# IPBasedDeviceURIs IPv4
# IPBasedDeviceURIs IPv6


# Set CreateIPPPrinterQueues to "Yes" to let cups-browsed discover IPP
# network printers (native printers, not CUPS queues) with known page
# description languages (PWG Raster, PDF, PostScript, PCL XL, PCL
# 5c/e) in the local network and auto-create PPD-less print queues for
# them (using a System V interface script to control the filter
# chain). Clients have to IPP-poll the capabilities of the printer and
# send option settings as standard IPP attributes. We do not poll the
# capabilities by ourselves to not wake up the printer from
# power-saving mode when creating the queues. Jobs have to be sent in
# PDF format. Other formats are not accepted. This functionality is
# primarily for mobile devices running CUPS to not need a printer
# setup tool nor a collection of printer drivers and PPDs.

# CreateIPPPrinterQueues Yes


# If cups-browsed is automatically creating print queues for native
# IPP network printers ("CreateIPPPrinterQueues Yes"), the type of
# queue to be created can be selected by the "IPPPrinterQueueType"
# directive.  The "PPD" setting makes always queues with PPD file
# being created and no queue if the printer does not supply sufficient
# information for creating a PPD. With "NoPPD" the queue is always
# created with a System V interface script as filter, also when
# creatig a PPD would be possible.  "Auto" (the default) lets a PPD
# being created if the printer supplies sufficient information and a
# System V interface script otherwise.

# IPPPrinterQueueType Auto
# IPPPrinterQueueType PPD
# IPPPrinterQueueType NoPPD


# The LoadBalancing directive switches between two methods of handling
# load balancing between equally-named remote queues which are
# represented by one local print queue making up a cluster of them
# (implicit class).

# The two methods are:

# Queuing of jobs on the client (LoadBalancing QueueOnClient):

# Here we queue up the jobs on the client and regularly check the
# clustered remote print queues. If we find an idle queue, we pass
# on a job to it.

# This is also the method which CUPS uses for classes. Advantage is a
# more even distribution of the job workload on the servers
# (especially if the printing speed of the servers is very different),
# and if a server fails, there are not several jobs stuck or
# lost. Disadvantage is that if one takes the client (laptop, mobile
# phone, ...) out of the local network, printing stops with the jobs
# waiting in the local queue.

# Queuing of jobs on the servers (LoadBalancing QueueOnServers):

# Here we check the number of jobs on each of the clustered remote
# printers and send an incoming job immediately to the remote printer
# with the lowest amount of jobs in its queue. This way no jobs queue
# up locally, all jobs which are waiting are waiting on one of the
# remote servers.

# Not having jobs waiting locally has the advantage that we can take
# the local machine from the network and all jobs get printed.
# Disadvantage is that if a server with a full queue of jobs goes
# away, the jobs go away, too.

# Default is queuing the jobs on the client as this is what CUPS does
# with classes.

# LoadBalancing QueueOnClient
# LoadBalancing QueueOnServers


# With the DefaultOptions directive one or more option settings can be
# defined to be applied to every print queue newly created by
# cups-browsed. Each option is supplied as one supplies options with
# the "-o" command line argument to the "lpadmin" command (Run "man
# lpadmin" for more details). More than one option can be supplied
# separating the options by spaces. By default no option settings are
# pre-defined.

# Note that print queues which cups-browsed already created before
# remember their previous settings and so these settings do not get
# applied.

# DefaultOptions Option1=Value1 Option2=Value2 Option3 noOption4


# The AutoShutdown directive specifies whether cups-browsed should
# automatically terminate when it has no local raw queues set up
# pointing to any discovered remote printers (auto shutdown
# mode). Setting it to "On" activates the auto-shutdown mode, setting
# it to "Off" deactiivates it (the default). The special mode "avahi"
# turns auto shutdown off while avahi-daemon is running and on when
# avahi-daemon stops. This allows running cups-browsed on-demand when
# avahi-daemon is run on-demand.

# AutoShutdown Off
# AutoShutdown On
# AutoShutdown avahi


# The AutoShutdownTimeout directive specifies after how many seconds
# without local raw queues set up pointing to any discovered remote
# printers cups-browsed should actually shut down in auto shutdown
# mode. Default is 30 seconds, 0 means immediate shutdown.

# AutoShutdownTimeout 30


# Unknown directives are ignored, also unknown values.
