CHANGES.txt - OpenPrinting CUPS Filters v1.0 - 2011-02-10
---------------------------------------------------------

CHANGES IN V1.0

	- Built the pdftops filter based on Ghostscript by default, as
	  Ghostscript is better optimized for print output (Ubuntu bug
	  #926068).
	- If the pdftops filter is built for using Poppler, let Poppler not
	  emit PostScript level 3, as this causes problems with some HP
	  printers (Ubuntu bug #277404, Freedesktop (Poppler) bug #19640).
	- bannertopdf needs to be linked with C++ (bug #995)
	- Added test.sh script for testing texttopdf
	- Added original documentation of the PDF filters to README.txt
	- Install C header files and the static library
	- General clean-up of "make install" targets in Makefiles
	- Raised MIME conversion cost factor of pdftoraster from 66 to 100 to
	  give priority to the gstoraster filter from Ghostscript, as this
	  filter supports ICC-profile-based color management.
	- Documentation updated because libijs, liblcms, freetype, and
          fontconfig are needed to build this package
