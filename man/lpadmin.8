       _l_p_a_d_m_i_n  configures  printer  and class queues provided by
       CUPS. It can also  be  used  to  set  the  system  default
       printer or class.

       The  first form of the command sets the default printer or
       class to _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n.  Subsequent print jobs submitted via
       the  _l_p_(_1_)  or  _l_p_r_(_1_)  commands will use this destination
       unless the user specifies otherwise.

       The second  form  of  the  command  configures  the  named
       printer.  The additional options are described below.

       The third form of the command deletes the printer or class
       _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n.  Any jobs that are pending for  the  destina-
       tion will be removed and any job that is currently printed
       will be aborted.

       The following options are recognized  when  configuring  a
       printer queue:

       -c _c_l_a_s_s
            Adds  the  named _p_r_i_n_t_e_r to _c_l_a_s_s.  If _c_l_a_s_s does not
            exist it is created automatically.

       -i _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e
            Sets a  System  V  style  interface  script  for  the
            printer.  This option cannot be specified with the _-_P
            option (PPD file) and is intended for providing  sup-
            port for legacy printer drivers.

       -m _m_o_d_e_l
            Sets a standard System V interface script or PPD file
            from the model directory.

       -r _c_l_a_s_s
            Removes the named _p_r_i_n_t_e_r from _c_l_a_s_s.  If the result-
            ing class becomes empty it is removed.

       -v _d_e_v_i_c_e_-_u_r_i
            Sets  the  _d_e_v_i_c_e_-_u_r_i attribute of the printer queue.
            If _d_e_v_i_c_e_-_u_r_i is a filename it is automatically  con-
            verted to the form ffiillee:://ffiillee//nnaammee.

       -D _i_n_f_o
            Provides a textual description of the printer.

       -E
            Enables  the  printer  and  accepts jobs; this is the
            same as running the _a_c_c_e_p_t_(_8_) and _e_n_a_b_l_e_(_8_)  programs
            on the printer.

       -L _l_o_c_a_t_i_o_n
            Provides a textual location of the printer.

       -P _p_p_d_-_f_i_l_e
            Specifies  a  PostScript  Printer Description file to
            use with the printer. If specified, this option over-
            rides the _-_i option (interface script).

CCOOMMPPAATTIIBBIILLIITTYY
       Unlike  the  System V printing system, CUPS allows printer
       names to contain any printable character except SPACE  and
       TAB. Also, printer and class names are nnoott case-sensitive.
       Finally, the CUPS version of _l_p_a_d_m_i_n may ask the user  for
       an  access  password depending on the printing system con-
       figuration.  This differs from the System V version  which
       requires the root user to execute this command.

LLIIMMIITTAATTIIOONNSS
       The  CUPS  version  of _l_p_a_d_m_i_n does not support all of the
       System V or Solaris printing system configuration options.
