CHANGES.txt - OpenPrinting CUPS Filters v1.0.8 - 2012-03-22
-----------------------------------------------------------

CHANGES IN V1.0.8

	- pdftops: Generally do not compress fonts and images, and
	  also do not do CCITT compression for bitmap glyphs to make
	  the PostScript output more compatible with buggy PostScript
	  interpreters. The output gets 30-50% longer but will work on
	  many more different printer models. Problems were also
	  discovered on HP and not only on Brother (Ubuntu bug
	  #960666).

CHANGES IN V1.0.7

	- pdftops: Added PostScript debug mode. For jobs sent with "-o psdebug"
	  the PostScript output by Ghostscript does not have compression of
	  pages and fonts, so that one can analyse the PostScript code,
	  especially in cases of incompatibilities and bugs of the built-in
	  PostScript interpreters of printers. Thanks to the Ghostscript
	  upstream developers for this hint.

CHANGES IN V1.0.6

	- texttopdf: Fixed minor miscalculation of /AvgWidth.
	- texttopdf: Added support for direct file references in pdf.utf-8.
	- pdftops: Added another workaround for a bug in Brother's PostScript
	  interpreter: Suppress CCITT compression for bitmap glyphs and
	  images on Brother printers (Ubuntu bug #955553).
	- texttopdf: Fixed typo in pdf font descriptor dictionary keys.
	- Fixed ColorDevice definition in cupsfilters.drv for HP DesignJet
	  printers.
	- Put ModelNumber entries in cupsfilters.drv at the right place to
	  get correct "*cupsModelNumber:" entries in the PPDs for the HP
	  DesignJet printers.
	- rastertopclx: Code of JCL options did not get inserted into the JCL
	  header.
	- parallel backend: Use the same way as CUPS does to prevent an
	  infinite loop on side channel errors (CUPS STR #4044).
	- pdftopdf: Added support for native PDF printers, add JCL (PJL) 
	  options and send page_log entries only if the PDF has the
	  "*JCLToPDFInterpreter:" keyword.
	- Updated README.txt for the new native PDF printer support.
	- Added a sample PPD file for a native PDF printer,
	  HP-Color_LaserJet_CM3530_MFP-PDF.ppd.
	- texttopdf: A lot of internal rework; also split up into more files
	- texttopdf: Fixed many bugs on the way
	- texttopdf: Added support for CFF-flavoured OTFs; for these
          subsetting is not yet implemented, full embedding is done instead
	- texttopdf: Adapted and improved fontconfig font selection
	- Make sure that "make clean" and "make distclean" also work if
	  Makedefs does not exist (Debian bug #663564).

CHANGES IN V1.0.5

	- pdftops: Added insertion of workaround PostScript code for printers
	  with bugs in their PS interpreters (Ubuntu bugs #950713, #951627).
	- parallel backend: Break infinite loop (Ubuntu bug #936647).
	- texttopdf: Complete the implementation of fontconfig-based font
	  selection (Debian bug #663070).

CHANGES IN V1.0.4

	- texttopdf: Fall back to altermative fonts via fontconfig if the
	  FreeMono TrueType fonts are not installed (Debian bugs #495598
	  and #662660).
	- bannertopdf: Fix off-by-one error in page duplication
	- bannertopdf: Put indirect references to streams into the page's
	  contents
	- bannertopdf: Let byte offsets for the Xref table of the PDF output
	  being determined correctly also when the output goes to stdout
	  (Ubuntu bug #939735).
	- bannertopdf: Output multiple copies of the test page if duplex
	  and/or N-up is chosen, to let the test page appear on all possible
	  positions of the sheet (Ubuntu bug #939530).

CHANGES IN V1.0.3

	- bannertopdf: Draw the frame to mark the non-printable borders 1pt
	  smaller all around to assure that it is always visible, like it was
	  done in bannertops.
	- bannertopdf: Scale the page to fit onto the desired output page.
	- bannertopdf: Get and output the correct media limits.

CHANGES IN V1.0.2

	- bannertopdf: Fixed crash caused by wrong Poppler API use.
	- bannertopdf: Info text on test page came out in gray and not in
	  black.

CHANGES IN V1.0.1

	- Added the textonly filter and its PPD file, a driver for text-only
	  printers.
	- Install the pdftoijs sample PPD file
	  HP-PhotoSmart_Pro_B8300-hpijs-pdftoijs.ppd
	- Added cupsfilters.drv, centralized ppdc-based PPD generator for the
	  printer driver filters in this package. Current printers supported
	  are several HP DesignJet large format inkjet printers.
	- Fixed "make uninstall". Now everything of this package gets removed.
	- Added wrapper scripts texttops and imagetops for backward
	  compatibility to third-party PPD files or custom configurations
	  which refer to these filters explicitly (Debian bug #658258).

CHANGES IN V1.0

	- Built the pdftops filter based on Ghostscript by default, as
	  Ghostscript is better optimized for print output (Ubuntu bug
	  #926068).
	- If the pdftops filter is built for using Poppler, let Poppler not
	  emit PostScript level 3, as this causes problems with some HP
	  printers (Ubuntu bug #277404, Freedesktop (Poppler) bug #19640).
	- bannertopdf needs to be linked with C++ (bug #995)
	- Added test.sh script for testing texttopdf
	- Added original documentation of the PDF filters to README.txt
	- Install C header files and the static library
	- General clean-up of "make install" targets in Makefiles
	- Raised MIME conversion cost factor of pdftoraster from 66 to 100 to
	  give priority to the gstoraster filter from Ghostscript, as this
	  filter supports ICC-profile-based color management.
	- Documentation updated because libijs, liblcms, freetype, and
          fontconfig are needed to build this package

CHANGES IN V1.0b1

	- Removed the bannertops, imagetops, and texttops filters, they are
	  not needed any more in the PDF-based printing workflow
	- Added support for liblcms2
	- Named the package "OpenPrinting CUPS Filters"
	- Renamed libcupslegacy to libcupsfilters
	- Joined pdftops and cpdftocps filters into one C program
	- Added new bannertopdf filter from Lars Uebernickel:
	  https://launchpad.net/bannertopdf
	- Added the filters for the PDF-based printing workflow, from
	  OpenPrinting: http://sourceforge.jp/projects/opfc/ and
	  http://www.openprinting.org/download/printing/pdf-printing/
	- Initial packaging of files that are no longer included in CUPS 1.6
	  from CUPS upstream (http://www.cups.org/)
