.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIlpadmin\fR configures printer and class queues provided by CUPS. It can also
be used to set the system default printer or class.
.LP
The first form of the command sets the default printer or class to
\fIdestination\fR.  Subsequent print jobs submitted via the \fIlp(1)\fR or
\fIlpr(1)\fR commands will use this destination unless the user specifies
otherwise.
.LP
The second form of the command configures the named printer.  The additional
options are described below.
.LP
The third form of the command deletes the printer or class \fIdestination\fR.
Any jobs that are pending for the destination will be removed and any job that
is currently printed will be aborted.
.SH CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
The following options are recognized when configuring a printer queue:
.TP 5
\-c \fIclass\fR
.br
Adds the named \fIprinter\fR to \fIclass\fR.  If \fIclass\fR does not
exist it is created automatically.
.TP 5
\-i \fIinterface\fR
.br
Sets a System V style interface script for the printer.  This option cannot
be specified with the \fI\-P\fR option (PPD file) and is intended for
providing support for legacy printer drivers.
.TP 5
\-m \fImodel\fR
.br
Sets a standard System V interface script or PPD file from the model
directory.
.TP 5
\-o \fIname=value\fR
.br
Sets a PPD or server option for the printer. PPD options can be listed
using the \fI-l\fR option with the \fIlpoptions(1)\fR command.
.TP 5
\-r \fIclass\fR
.br
Removes the named \fIprinter\fR from \fIclass\fR.  If the resulting class
becomes empty it is removed.
.TP 5
\-u \fIallow:user,user\fR
\-u \fIdeny:user,user\fR
\-u \fIallow:all\fR
\-u \fIdeny:none\fR
.br
Sets user-level access control on a printer. The latter two forms turn
user-level access control off.
.TP 5
\-v \fIdevice-uri\fR
.br
Sets the \fIdevice-uri\fR attribute of the printer queue.  If \fIdevice-uri\fR
is a filename it is automatically converted to the form \fBfile:/file/name\fR.
.TP 5
\-D \fIinfo\fR
.br
Provides a textual description of the printer.
.TP 5
\-E
.br
Enables the printer and accepts jobs; this is the same as running the
\fIaccept(8)\fR and \fIenable(8)\fR programs on the printer.
.TP 5
\-L \fIlocation\fR
.br
Provides a textual location of the printer.
.TP 5
\-P \fIppd-file\fR
.br
Specifies a PostScript Printer Description file to use with the printer. If
specified, this option overrides the \fI-i\fR option (interface script).
.SH COMPATIBILITY
Unlike the System V printing system, CUPS allows printer names to contain
any printable character except SPACE and TAB. Also, printer and class names are
\fBnot\fR case-sensitive. Finally, the CUPS version of \fIlpadmin\fR may ask the
user for an access password depending on the printing system configuration.
This differs from the System V version which requires the root user to execute
this command.
.SH LIMITATIONS
The CUPS version of \fIlpadmin\fR does not support all of the System V or
Solaris printing system configuration options.
