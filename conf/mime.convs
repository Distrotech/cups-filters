#   source/type destination/type cost filter
#
# General Notes:
#
#   Currently the "cost" field is not used (all filters are assumed to
#   be equally costly in terms of speed/memory).  Also, a filter program
#   *must* accept the standard command-line arguments (job-id, user, title,
#   copies,options,[filename or stdin]) or this won't work.
