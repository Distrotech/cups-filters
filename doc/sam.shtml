<H1 ALIGN=RIGHT>Preface</H1>

This software administrators manual provides printer administration
information for the Common UNIX Printing System ("CUPS") Version 1.0.3.

<H2>System Overview</H2>

The Common UNIX Printing System provides a portable printing layer for 
UNIX&reg; operating systems. It has been developed by Easy Software 
Products to promote a standard printing solution for all UNIX vendors 
and users. CUPS provides the System V and Berkeley command-line interfaces.

<P>CUPS uses the Internet Printing Protocol (IETF-IPP) as the basis
for managing print jobs and queues. The Line Printer Daemon (LPD,
RFC1179), Server Message Block (SMB), and AppSocket protocols are also
supported with reduced functionality.

<P>CUPS adds network printer browsing and PostScript Printer
Description (&quot;PPD&quot;)-based printing options to support real
world applications under UNIX.

<P>CUPS also includes a customized version of GNU GhostScript
(currently based off GNU GhostScript 4.03) and an image file RIP that
can be used to support non-PostScript printers.

<H2>Document Overview</H2>

<P>This software administrators manual is organized into the following sections:</P>

<H1 ALIGN=RIGHT>1 - Printing System Overview</H1>

<P>This chapter provides an overview of how the Common UNIX Printing System
works.

<H2>The Printing Problem</H2>

<P>For years <I>the printing problem</I> has plagued UNIX&reg;. Unlike
Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; or MacOS, UNIX has no standard interface or
system in place for supporting printers. Among the solutions previously
available, the Berkeley and System V printing systems are the most
prevalent.

<P>These printing systems support line printers (text only) or
PostScript printers (text and graphics), and with some coaxing they can
be made to support a full range of printers and file formats. However,
because each varient of the UNIX operating system uses a different
printing system than the next, developing printer drivers for a wide
range of printers is extremely difficult. That combined with the
limited volume of customers for each UNIX varient has forced most
printer vendors to give up supporting UNIX entirely.

<P>The Common UNIX Printing System, or CUPS, is designed to eliminate
<I>the printing problem</I>. One common printing system can be used by
all UNIX varients to support the printing needs of users. Printer
vendors can use its modular filter interface to develop a single driver
program that supports a wide range of file formats with little or no
effort.  Since CUPS provides both the System V and Berkeley printing
commands, users (and applications) can reap the benefits of this new
technology with no changes.

<H2>The Technology</H2>

<P>CUPS is based upon an emerging Internet standard called the Internet
Printing Protocol, or IPP. IPP has been embraced by dozens of printer
and printer server manufacturers, and will be supported by the next
Microsoft Windows operating system.

<P>IPP defines a standard protocol for printing as well as managing print
jobs and printer options like media size, resolution, and so forth. Like all
IP-based protocols, IPP can be used locally or over the Internet to printers
hundreds or thousands of miles away. Unlike other protocols, however, IPP
also supports access control, authentication, and encryption, making it a
much more secure printing solution than older ones.

<P>IPP is layered on top of the Hyper-Text Transport Protocol, or HTTP,
which is the basis of web servers on the Internet. This allows the user to
view documentation and status information on a printer or server using their
web browser.

<P>CUPS provides a complete IPP/1.0-based printing system that provides Basic
authentication and domain or IP-based access control. Digest authentication
and TLS encryption will be available in future versions of CUPS.

<H2>Jobs</H2>

<P>Each file that is submitted for printing is called a <I>job</I>. 
Jobs are identified by a unique number starting at 1 and are assigned
to a particular destination (usually a printer). Jobs can also have
options associated with them such as media size, number of copies, and
priority.

<H2>Classes</H2>

<P>CUPS supports collections of printers known as <I>classes</I>. Jobs sent
to a class are forwarded to the first available printer in the class.

<H2>Filters</H2>

<P>Filters allow a user or application to print many types of files
without extra effort. Print jobs sent to a CUPS server are filtered
before sending them to a printer. Some filters convert job files to
different formats that the printer can understand. Others perform page
selection and ordering tasks. <I>Backend</I> filters perform the most
important task of all - they send the filtered print data to the
printer.

<P>CUPS provides filters for printing many types of image files,
HP-GL/2 files, PDF files, and text files. CUPS also supplies
PostScript and image file Raster Image Processors, or RIPs, that
convert PostScript or image files into bitmaps that can be sent to a
raster printer.

<P>CUPS provides backends for printing over parallel and serial ports,
and over the network via the JetDirect (AppSocket), Server Message
Block, and Line Printer Daemon protocols.

<H2>Printer Drivers</H2>

<P>Printer drivers in CUPS consist of one of more filters specific to a
printer. CUPS includes a sample printer driver for Hewlett-Packard
LaserJet and DeskJet printers. While this driver does not generate
optimal output for different printer models, it does demonstrate how
you can write your own printer drivers and incorporate them into CUPS.

<H2>Networking</H2>

<P>Printers and classes on the local system are automatically shared with
other systems on the network. This allows you to setup one system to print
to a printer and use this system as a printer server or spool host for all
of the others.  If there is only one occurrence of a printer on a network,
then that printer can be accessed using its name alone. If more than one
printer exists with the same name, users must select the printer by specifying
which server to use (e.g. "printer@host1" or "printer@host2".)

<P>CUPS also provides <I>implicit classes</I>, which are collections of
printers and/or classes with the same name. This allows you to setup multiple
servers pointing to the same physical network printer, for example, so that
you aren't relying on a single system for printing. Because this also works
with printer classes, you can setup multiple servers and printers and never
worry about a "single point of failure" unless all of the printers and servers
goes down!

<H1 ALIGN=RIGHT>2 - Building and Installing CUPS</H1>

<P>This chapter shows how to build and install the Common UNIX Printing System.
If you are installing a binary distribution from the CUPS web site, proceed to
the section titled, <A HREF="#binary">Installing a Binary Distribution</A>.

<H2>Installing a Source Distribution</H2>

<H3>Requirements</H3>

<P>You'll need an ANSI C compiler to build CUPS on your system. As its name
implies, CUPS is designed to run on the UNIX operating system, however
the CUPS interface library and most of the filters and backends supplied
with CUPS should also run under Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg;.

<P>For the image file filters and PostScript RIP, you'll need the JPEG,
PNG, TIFF, and ZLIB libraries. CUPS will build without these, but with
reduced functionality. Easy Software Products maintains a mirror of the
current versions of these libraries at:

<UL><PRE>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.easysw.com/pub/libraries">ftp://ftp.easysw.com/pub/libraries</A>
</PRE></UL>

<P>If you make changes to the man pages you'll need GNU groff or another
nroff-like package. GNU groff is available from:

<UL><PRE>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/groff">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/groff</A>
</PRE></UL>

<P>The documentation is formatted using the HTMLDOC software. If you need to
make changes you can get the HTMLDOC software from:

<UL><PRE>
<A HREF="http://www.easysw.com/htmldoc">http://www.easysw.com/htmldoc</A>
</PRE></UL>

<H3>Compiling CUPS</H3>

<P>CUPS uses GNU autoconf to configure the makefiles and source code
for your system. To configure CUPS for your system type:

<UL><PRE>
% ./configure ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>The default installation will put the CUPS software in the
<CODE>/usr</CODE> and <CODE>/var</CODE> directories on your system,
which will overwrite any existing printing commands on your system. To
install the CUPS software in another location use the
<CODE>--prefix</CODE> option:

<UL><PRE>
% ./configure --prefix=/usr/local ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>If the PNG, JPEG, TIFF, and ZLIB libraries are not installed in a
system default location (typically <CODE>/usr/include</CODE> and
<CODE>/usr/lib</CODE>) you'll need to set the <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> and
<CODE>LDFLAGS</CODE> environment variables prior to running configure:

<UL><PRE>
% setenv CFLAGS "-I/some/directory"
% setenv LDFLAGS "-L/some/directory"
% ./configure ... ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>Once you have configured things, just type:

<UL><PRE>
% make ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>to build the software.

<H3>Installing the Software</H3>

<P>To install the software type:

<UL><PRE>
% make install ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<H3>Running the Software</A></H3>

Once you have installed the software you can start the CUPS daemon by
typing:

<UL><PRE>
% /usr/sbin/cupsd &amp; ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<H2><A NAME="binary">Installing a Binary Distribution</A></H2>

<P>We are currently distributing CUPS binary distributions in TAR format
with installation and removal scripts.

<UL>
	<B>WARNING:</B>
	
	<P>Installing CUPS will overwrite your existing printing
	system. If you experience difficulties with the CUPS software
	and need to go back to your old printing system, you will need
	to remove the CUPS software with the provided script and
	reinstall the printing system from your operating system CDs.
</UL>

<P>To install the CUPS software you will need to be logged in as root
(doing an "su" is good enough). Once you are the root user, run the
installation script with:

<UL><PRE>
./cups.install ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>After asking you a few yes/no questions the CUPS software will be
installed and the scheduler will be started automatically.

<H1 ALIGN=RIGHT>3 - Printer Queue Management</H1>

<P>This chapter discusses how to add, modify, and delete print queues
on your system.

<H2>The lpadmin Command</H2>

<P>The <CODE>lpadmin</CODE> command allows you to perform most printer
administration tasks from the command-line. Since <CODE>lpadmin</CODE>
is also a System V printing system command, it is located in the
<CODE>/usr/lib</CODE> directory instead of a more common one like
<CODE>/usr/bin</CODE> or <CODE>/usr/sbin</CODE>.

<H2>Adding and Modifying Printers</H2>

<P>To add a printer to CUPS you simply run the <CODE>lpadmin</CODE> command
with the "-p" option:

<UL><PRE>
% /usr/lib/lpadmin -p<I>printer</I> -E -v<I>device</I> -P<I>ppd</I> ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>Spaces between the option letter and value are optional.

<P>The <I>printer</I> name can be up to 127 letters, digits, hyphens,
and underscores. Unlike other printing systems, the printer name in
CUPS is <I>not</I> case-sensitive, so you can't add two printers named
<CODE>LaserJet</CODE> and <CODE>laserjet</CODE>.

<P>The <I>device</I> argument specifies the device URI or filename for the
printer. The following devices are supported in a basic installation of
CUPS:

<DL>

	<DT>file:/dev/filename
	<DT>/dev/filename
	<DD>Sends all output to the specified file.

	<DT>http://[username:password@]hostname[:port]/resource
	<DT>ipp://[username:password@]hostname[:port]/resource
	<DD>Sends all output to the specified IPP printer or server.
	The <I>port</I> parameters defaults to 631.

	<DT>lpd://hostname/queue
	<DD>Sends all output to the specified LPD printer queue.

	<DT>parallel:/dev/filename
	<DD>Sends all output to the specified parallel port device.

	<DT>serial:/dev/filename[?options]
	<DD>Sends all output to the specified serial port device.  The
	<I>options</I> can be any of the following separated by the
	plus (+) character:
	<UL>
		<LI><CODE>baud=<I>rate</I></CODE> - Sets the baud rate
		for the device.
		<LI><CODE>bits=<I>7 or 8</I></CODE> - Sets the number
		of data bits.
		<LI><CODE>parity=<I>even</I></CODE> - Sets even parity
		checking.
		<LI><CODE>parity=<I>odd</I></CODE> - Sets odd parity
		checking.
		<LI><CODE>parity=<I>none</I></CODE> - Turns parity
		checking off.
	</UL>

	<DT>smb://[username:password@]hostname/queue
	<DT>smb://[username:password@]workgroup/hostname/queue
	<DD>Sends all output to the specified SMB (Windows) printer queue
	using the SAMBA software.

	<DT>socket://hostname[:port]
	<DD>Sends all output to the specified printer using the
	AppSocket protocol. The <I>port</I> parameter defaults to 9100.

</DL>

<P>The <I>ppd</I> argument specifies the PostScript Printer Description file
to use for this printer. Many options (such as media size, etc.) will not
be available if you omit this part of the <CODE>lpadmin</CODE> command.

<H3>Using Standard Printer Drivers</H2>

<P>The <CODE>lpadmin</CODE> command allows you to use "standard" PPD files
and interface scripts located in the <CODE>/usr/share/cups/model</CODE>
directory with the "-m" option:

<UL><PRE>
% /usr/lib/lpadmin -p<I>printer</I> -E -v<I>device</I> -m<I>model</I> ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <I>model</I> argument specifies the name of the PPD file or interface
script. For example, to add a printer using the sample HP DeskJet series
driver connected to parallel port 1 under Linux you would use:

<UL><PRE>
% /usr/lib/lpadmin -pDeskJet -E -vparallel:/dev/par1 -mdeskjet.ppd ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<H2>Removing Printers</H2>

<P>To remove a printer to CUPS you simply run the <CODE>lpadmin</CODE> command
with the "-x" option:

<UL><PRE>
% /usr/lib/lpadmin -x<I>printer</I> ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<H2>Printer Classes</H2>

<P>CUPS allows you to group similar printers in a <I>printer class</I>. When
a user sends a print job to a class, the job will be processed by the first
available printer in that class.

<P>To add a printer to a class you simply run the <CODE>lpadmin</CODE> command
with the "-p" and "-c" options:

<UL><PRE>
% /usr/lib/lpadmin -p<I>printer</I> -c<I>class</I> ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <I>class</I> is created automatically if it doesn't exist. To remove a
class just use the "-x" option:

<UL><PRE>
% /usr/lib/lpadmin -x<I>class</I> ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<H2>Setting the Default Printer</H2>

<P>To set the default printer or class simply run the <CODE>lpadmin</CODE>
command with the "-d" option:

<UL><PRE>
% /usr/lib/lpadmin -d<I>destination</I> ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <I>destination</I> argument is the name of the printer or class.

<H2>Starting and Stopping Printers</H2>

<P>The <CODE>enable</CODE> and <CODE>disable</CODE> commands start and stop
printer queues, respectively:

<UL><PRE>
% /usr/bin/enable <I>printer</I> ENTER
% /usr/bin/disable <I>printer</I> ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>Printers that are disabled may still accept jobs for printing, but won't
actually print any files until they are restarted. This is useful if the
printer malfunctions and you need time to correct the problem. Any queues
jobs are printed after the printer is enabled (started).

<H2>Accepting and Rejecting Print Jobs</H2>

<P>The <CODE>accept</CODE> and <CODE>reject</CODE> commands accept and reject
print jobs for the named printer, respectively:

<UL><PRE>
% /usr/lib/accept <I>printer</I> ENTER
% /usr/lib/reject <I>printer</I> ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>As noted above, a printer can be stopped but accepting new print
jobs. A printer can also be rejecting new print jobs while it finishes
those that have been queued. This is useful for when you must perform
maintenance on the printer and will not have it available to users for
a long period of time.

<H1 ALIGN=RIGHT>4 - Printing System Management</H1>

<P>This chapter shows how you can configure the CUPS server.

<H2>Changing the Configuration Files</H2>

<P>All of the server configuration files are located in the
<CODE>/var/cups/conf</CODE> directory. Once you have made a change to a
file you need to restart the CUPS server by sending it a HUP signal or
using the supplied script "<CODE>cups.sh</CODE>":

<UL><PRE>
% ./cups.sh restart ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>The binary distribution installs the script in the
<CODE>init.d</CODE> directory with the name <CODE>lp</CODE> or
<CODE>lpd</CODE> depending on the vendor-supplied printing system.

<H2>Temporary Files</H2>

<P>Normally CUPS puts all of its temporary files in <CODE>/var/tmp</CODE>.
If you'd like to change this directory you'll need to edit the
<CODE>/var/cups/conf/cupsd.conf</CODE> file.

<P>Start by creating the new temporary directory and setting the appropriate
permissions:

<UL><PRE>
% mkdir <I>/foo/bar/tmp</I> ENTER
% chmod a+rwxt <I>/foo/bar/tmp</I> ENTER
</PRE></UL>

<P>Then change the line containing the <CODE>TempDir</CODE> directive in
the <CODE>cupsd.conf</CODE> to the directory that you've created:

<UL><PRE>
TempDir <I>/foo/bar/tmp</I>
</PRE></UL>

<P>Finally, restart the server as outlined in the first section of this
chapter.

<H2>Network Configuration</H2>

<P>The default configuration of the CUPS server listens for connections from
all network interfaces on port 631 (the standard IPP port). Administration
functions are limited to local connections with the appropriate username and
password.

<P>If you'd like to limit access to your system you'll need to edit the
<CODE>/var/cups/conf/cupsd.conf</CODE> file.

<H3>Port</H3>

<P>The <CODE>Port</CODE> directive specifies a port to listen on for
all interfaces. Besides the standard IPP port (631) you can also setup
your server to listen on the HTTP port (80) to use your CUPS server as
a standard web server as well.

<H3>Listen</H3>

<P>The <CODE>Listen</CODE> directive specifies a listening address and port,
extending the functionality of the <CODE>Port</CODE> directive. If you want
to allow connections only from the local machine you can use:

<UL><PRE>
Listen 127.0.0.1:631
</PRE></UL>

<P>instead of the <CODE>Port</CODE> directive.

<P>If you want to limit access to a specific network/subnet, make sure you
specify only the network address and not your system's network address!

<H3>BrowsePort</H3>

<P>The <CODE>BrowsePort</CODE> directive controls which port is monitored for
remote printers. By default it is set to the IPP port (631), however you can
change it as needed.

<UL>

	<B>NOTE:</B>

	<P>You must set the <CODE>BrowsePort</CODE> to the same value
	on all of the systems that you want to see.

</UL>

<H3>BrowseAddress</H3>

<P>The <CODE>BrowseAddress</CODE> directive specifies a broadcast address to
use when sending printer status updates over the network. The default
browse address is <CODE>255.255.255.255</CODE> which will send printer
information to all subnets.

<UL>

	<B>NOTE:</B>

	<P>If you are using HP-UX 10.20 and a subnet that is not 24,
	16, or 8 bits, printer browsing (and in fact all broadcast
	reception) will not work. This problem appears to be fixed in
	HP-UX 11.0.

</UL>

<H2>Printer Security</H2>

<P>CUPS provides IP and domain-name based access control and Basic
authentication for authentication.

<H3>Location</H3>

<P>The <CODE>Location</CODE> directive defines access control for a
specific HTTP directory. The following pseudo directories are provided
by the CUPS server:

<UL>

	<LI><CODE>/admin</CODE> - This is the URI that must be referenced to
	do printer administation commands.

	<LI><CODE>/classes</CODE> - This is the URI that must be referenced to
	access printer classes.

	<LI><CODE>/jobs</CODE> - This is the URI that must be referenced to
	access jobs.

	<LI><CODE>/printers</CODE> - This is the URI that must be referenced to
	access printers.

</UL>

<P>All other directories are taken from the
<CODE>/usr/share/cups/doc</CODE> directory.

<P>The <CODE>Location</CODE> directive surrounds the other access control
directives described below. The default server configuration uses:

<UL><PRE>
&lt;Location /admin&gt;
AuthType Basic
AuthClass System

Order Deny,Allow
Deny From All
Allow From 127.0.0.1
&lt;/Location&gt;
</PRE></UL>

<H3>Order</H3>

<P>The <CODE>Order</CODE> directive defines the default access control.
The following values are supported:

<UL>

	<LI><CODE>Order Allow,Deny</CODE> - Allow requests from all
	systems <I>except</I> for those listed in a <CODE>Deny</CODE>
	directive.

	<LI><CODE>Order Deny,Allow</CODE> - Allow requests only from
	those listed in an <CODE>Allow</CODE> directive.

</UL>

<P>The <CODE>Order</CODE> directive must appear inside a
<CODE>Location</CODE> directive.

<H3>Allow</H3>

<P>The <CODE>Allow</CODE> directive specifies a hostname, IP address, or
network that is allowed access to the server:

<UL><PRE>
Allow from All
Allow from None
Allow from *.domain.com
Allow from .domain.com
Allow from host.domain.com
Allow from nnn.*
Allow from nnn.nnn.*
Allow from nnn.nnn.nnn.*
Allow from nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn
Allow from nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn/mm
Allow from nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn/mmm.mmm.mmm.mmm
</PRE></UL>

<P><CODE>Allow</CODE> directives are cummulative, so multiple <CODE>Allow</CODE>
directives can be used to allow access for multiple hosts or networks.  The
<CODE>/mm</CODE> notation specifies a CIDR netmask:

<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="80%" BORDER="1">

<H3>Deny</H3>

<P>The <CODE>Deny</CODE> directive specifies a hostname, IP address, or
network that is allowed access to the server:

<UL><PRE>
Deny from All
Deny from None
Deny from *.domain.com
Deny from .domain.com
Deny from host.domain.com
Deny from nnn.*

<P>The <CODE>Deny</CODE> directive must appear inside a
<CODE>Location</CODE> directive.

<H3>AuthType</H3>

<P>The <CODE>AuthType</CODE> directive defines the type of authentication to
perform:

<UL>

	<LI><CODE>None</CODE> - No authentication should be performed
	(default.)

	<LI><CODE>Basic</CODE> - Basic authentication should be
	performed using the UNIX password and group files.

</UL>

<P>The <CODE>AuthType</CODE> directive must appear inside a

<H3>AuthClass</H3>

<P>The <CODE>AuthClass</CODE> directive defines what level of <CODE>Basic</CODE>
access is required:

<UL>

	<LI><CODE>Anonymous</CODE> - No authentication should be performed
	(default.)

	<LI><CODE>User</CODE> - A valid username and password is required.

	<LI><CODE>System</CODE> - A valid username and password is
	required, and the username must belong to the "sys" group (this
	can be changed using the <CODE>SystemGroup</CODE> directive,
	below.

	<LI><CODE>Group</CODE> - A valid username and password is
	required, and the username must belong to the group named by
	the <CODE>AuthGroupName</CODE> directive.

</UL>

<P>The <CODE>AuthClass</CODE> directive must appear inside a
<CODE>Location</CODE> directive.

<H3>AuthGroupName</H3>

<P>The <CODE>AuthGroupName</CODE> directive sets the group to use for
<CODE>Group</CODE> authentication.

<P>The <CODE>AuthGroupName</CODE> directive must appear inside a
<CODE>Location</CODE> directive.

<H3>SystemGroup</H3>

<P>The <CODE>SystemGroup</CODE> directive sets the administration group used
when authenticating the <CODE>System</CODE> type. It defaults to the "sys"
group.

<H2>File Formats</H2>

<P>CUPS provides a MIME-based file typing and filtering mechanism to
convert files to a printable format for each printer. The
<CODE>mime.types</CODE> and <CODE>mime.convs</CODE> files define the
file type and filters that are available on the system.

<H3>mime.types</H3>

<P>The <CODE>mime.types</CODE> defines the known file types. Each line
of the file starts with the MIME type and may be followed by one or
more file type recognition rules. For example, the
<CODE>text/html</CODE> file type is defined as:

<UL><PRE>
text/html html htm \
          printable(0,1024) + (string(0,"&lt;HTML&gt;") string(0,"&lt;!DOCTYPE"))
</PRE></UL>

<P>The first two rules say that any file with an extension of ".html" or
".htm" is a HTML file. The third rules says that any file whose first
1024 characters are printable text and starts with the strings "&lt;HTML&gt;"
or "&lt;!DOCTYPE" is a HTML file as well.

<P>The first two rules deal solely with the name of the file being
typed. This is useful when the original filename is known, however for
print files the server doesn't always have a filename to work with. The
third rule takes care of this possibility and automatically figures out
the file type based upon the contents of the file instead.

<P>The available tests are:

<UL>

	<LI><CODE>( expr )</CODE> - Parenthesis for expression grouping

	<LI><CODE>+</CODE> - Logical AND

	<LI><CODE>,</CODE> or whitespace - Logical OR

	<LI><CODE>!</CODE> - Logical NOT

	<LI><CODE>match("pattern")</CODE> - Pattern match on filename

	<LI><CODE>extension</CODE> - Pattern match on "*.extension"

	<LI><CODE>ascii(offset,length)</CODE> - True if bytes are valid
	printable ASCII (CR, NL, TAB, BS, 32-126)

	<LI><CODE>printable(offset,length)</CODE> - True if bytes are
	printable 8-bit chars (CR, NL, TAB, BS, 32-126, 160-254)

	<LI><CODE>string(offset,"string")</CODE> - True if bytes are
	identical to string

	<LI><CODE>char(offset,value)</CODE> - True if byte is identical

	<LI><CODE>short(offset,value)</CODE> - True if 16-bit integer
	is identical (network or "big-endian" byte order)

	<LI><CODE>int(offset,value)</CODE> - True if 32-bit integer is
	identical (network or "big-endian" byte order)

	<LI><CODE>locale("string")</CODE> - True if current locale
	matches string

</UL>

<H3>mime.convs</H3>

<P>The <CODE>mime.convs</CODE> file defines all of the filter programs that
are known to the system. Each line consists of:

<UL><PRE>
source destination cost program

text/plain application/postscript 50 texttops
application/vnd.cups-postscript application/vnd.cups-raster 50 pstoraster
image/* application/vnd.cups-postscript 50 imagetops
image/* application/vnd.cups-raster 50 imagetoraster
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <I>source</I> field is a MIME type, optionally using a wildcard for
the super-type or sub-type (e.g. "text/plain", "image/*", "*/postscript").

<P>The <I>destination</I> field is a MIME type defined in the
<CODE>mime.types</CODE> file.

<P>The <I>cost</I> field defines a relative cost for the filtering
operation from 1 to 100. The cost is used to choose between two
different sets of filters when converting a file. For example, to convert
from <CODE>image/jpeg</CODE> to <CODE>application/vnd.cups-raster</CODE>,
you could use the <CODE>imagetops</CODE> and <CODE>pstoraster</CODE>
filters for a total cost of 100, or the <CODE>imagetoraster</CODE> filter
for a total cost of 50.

<P>The <I>program</I> field defines the filter program to run; the
special program "-" can be used to make two file types equivalent. The
program must accept the standard filter arguments and environment
variables described in the CUPS Interface Design Document:

<UL><PRE>
program job user title options [filename]
</PRE></UL>

<P>If specified, the <I>filename</I> argument defines a file to read
when filtering, otherwise the filter must read from the standard input.
All filtered output must go to the standard output.

This chapter describes the CUPS log files.

<H2>Where to Find the Log Files</H2>

<P>The log files are normally stored in the <CODE>/var/cups/logs</CODE>
directory. You can change this by editing the
<CODE>/var/cups/conf/cupsd.conf</CODE> configuration file.

<H2>The access_log File</H2>

<P>The <CODE>access_log</CODE> file lists each HTTP resource that is accessed
by a web browser or CUPS/IPP client. Each line is in the so-called "Common
Log Format" used by many web servers and web reporting tools:

<UL><PRE>
host group user date-time \"method resource version\" status bytes

127.0.0.1 - - [20/May/1999:19:20:29 +0000] "POST /admin/ HTTP/1.1" 401 0
127.0.0.1 - mike [20/May/1999:19:20:31 +0000] "POST /admin/ HTTP/1.1" 200 0
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <I>host</I> field will normally only be an IP address unless you
have changed the <CODE>HostnameLookups</CODE> directive on in the
<CODE>cupsd.conf</CODE> file.

<P>The <I>group</I> field always contains "-".

<P>The <I>user</I> field is the authenticated username of the requesting user.
If no username and password is supplied for the request then this field
contains "-".

<P>The <I>date-time</I> field is the date and time of the request in Greenwich
Mean Time (a.k.a. ZULU) and is in the format:

<UL><PRE>
[DD/MON/YYYY:HH:MM:SS +0000]
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <I>method</I> field is the HTTP method used ("GET", "PUT", "POST", etc.)

<P>The <I>resource</I> field is the filename of the requested resource.

<P>The <I>version</I> field is the HTTP specification version used by the
client. For CUPS clients this will always be "HTTP/1.1".

<P>The <I>status</I> field contains the HTTP result status of the
request. Usually it is "200", but other HTTP status codes are possible.
For example, 401 is the "unauthorized access" status in the example
above.

<P>The <I>bytes</I> field contains the number of bytes in the request.
For POST requests the <I>bytes</I> field contains the number of bytes
of non-IPP data that is received from the client.

<H2>The error_log File</H2>

<P>The <CODE>error_log</CODE> file lists messages from the scheduler (errors,
warnings, etc.):

<UL><PRE>
level date-time message

I [20/May/1999:19:18:28 +0000] Job 1 queued on 'DeskJet' by 'mike'.
I [20/May/1999:19:21:02 +0000] Job 2 queued on 'DeskJet' by 'mike'.
I [20/May/1999:19:22:24 +0000] Job 2 was cancelled by 'mike'.
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <I>level</I> field contains the type of message:

<UL>

	<LI><CODE>E</CODE> - An error occurred.

	<LI><CODE>W</CODE> - The server was unable to perform some action.

	<LI><CODE>I</CODE> - Informational message.

	<LI><CODE>D</CODE> - Debugging message.

</UL>

<P>The <I>date-time</I> field contains the date and time of when the page
started printing. The format of this field is identical to the <I>data-time</I>
field in the <CODE>access_log</CODE> file.

<P>The <I>message</I> fields contains a free-form textual message.

<H2>The page_log File</H2>

<P>The <CODE>page_log</CODE> file lists each page that is sent to a printer.
Each line contains the following information:

<UL><PRE>
printer user job-id date-time page-number num-copies

DeskJet root 2 [20/May/1999:19:21:05 +0000] 1 0
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <I>printer</I> field contains the name of the printer that
printed the page. If you send a job to a printer class, this field will
contain the name of the printer that was assigned the job.

<P>The <I>user</I> field contains the name of the user (the IPP
<CODE>requesting-user-name</CODE> attribute) that submitted this file for
printing.

<P>The <I>job-id</I> field contains the job number of the page being printed.
Job numbers are reset to 1 whenever the CUPS server is started, so don't depend
on this number being unique!

<P>The <I>date-time</I> field contains the date and time of when the page
started printing. The format of this field is identical to the <I>data-time</I>
field in the <CODE>access_log</CODE> file.

<P>The <I>page-number</I> and <I>num-pages</I> fields contain the page number
and number of copies being printed of that page. For printer that can not
produce copies on their own, the <I>num-pages</I> field will always be 1.
