	<TITLE>CUPS Configuration Management Plan</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>

<P>This configuration management plan document provides the
guidelines for development and maintenance of the Common UNIX
Printing System ("CUPS") Version 1.2 software.</P>

<H2 CLASS="title"><A NAME="FILEMAN">File Management</A></H2>

<H3>Directory Structure</H3>

<P>Each source file shall be placed a sub-directory corresponding
to the software sub-system it belongs to ("scheduler", "cups",
etc.) To remain compatible with older UNIX filesystems, directory
names shall not exceed 16 characters in length.</P>

<H3>Source Files</H3>

<P>Source files shall be documented and formatted as described in
"<A HREF="#CODING">Coding Requirements</A>". To remain compatible
with older UNIX filesystems, source file names shall not exceed
16 characters in length.</P>

<H3>Configuration Management</H3>

<P>Source files shall be placed under the control of the
Subversion ("SVN") software. Source files shall be "checked in"
with each change so that modifications can be tracked, and each
check in must reference the applicable STRs that are affected, if
any. The following format <em>must</em> be used for commit log
messages:</P>

<PRE CLASS="command">
Summary of the change ("fix PostScript printing bug") along
with corresponding STRs ("STR #1, STR #6")

foo.cxx:
    - Detailed list of changes, by function
    - Include summary of design changes ("added new foo struct")

bar.h:
    - More detailed changes
</PRE>

<P>Primary development occurs on the <var>trunk</var> branch,
with changes merged back to release branches as needed.</P>


<H2 CLASS="title"><A NAME="STR">Trouble Report Processing</A></H2>

<P>A Software Trouble Report ("STR") shall be submitted every
time a user or vendor experiences a problem with the CUPS
software. Trouble reports are maintained in a database with one
of the following states:</P>

<OL>

	<LI>STR is closed with complete resolution</LI>

	<LI>STR is closed without resolution</LI>

	<LI>STR is active, waiting on information from submitter</LI>

	<LI>STR is pending with additional information from submitter</LI>

	<LI>STR is newly submitted</LI>

</OL>

<P>Trouble reports shall be processed using the following
steps.</P>

<H3>Classification</H3>

<P>When a trouble report is received it must be classified at one
of the following priority levels:</P>

<OL>

	<LI>Request for enhancement, e.g. asking for a
	feature</LI>

	<LI>Low, e.g. a documentation error or undocumented
	side-effect</LI>

	<LI>Moderate, e.g. unable to print a file or unable to
	compile the software</LI>

	<LI>High, e.g. unable to print to a printer or key
	functionality not working</LI>

	<LI>Critical, e.g. unable to print at all</LI>

</OL>

<P>Level 4 and 5 trouble reports must be resolved in the next
software release. Level 1 to 3 trouble reports are scheduled for
resolution in a specific release at the discretion of the release
coordinator.</P>

<P>The scope of the problem should also be determined as:</P>

<OL>

	<LI>Specific to a machine or printer</LI>

	<LI>Specific to an operating system</LI>

	<LI>Applies to all machines, printers, and operating systems</LI>

</OL>

<H3>Identification</H3>

<P>Once the level and scope of the trouble report is determined
the software sub-system(s) involved with the problem are
determined. This may involve additional communication with the
user or vendor to isolate the problem to a specific cause.</P>

<P>When the sub-system(s) involved have been identified, an
engineer will then determine the change(s) needed and estimate
the time required for the change(s).</P>

<H3>Correction</H3>

<P>Corrections are scheduled based upon the severity and
complexity of the problem. Once all changes have been made,
documented, and tested successfully a new software release
snapshot is generated. Additional tests are added as necessary
for proper testing of the changes.</P>

<H3>Notification</H3>

<P>The user or vendor is notified when the fix is available or if
the problem was caused by user error.</P>


<H2 CLASS="title"><A NAME="RELEASES">Software Releases</A></H2>

<H3>Version Numbering</H3>

<P>CUPS uses a three-part version number separated by periods to
represent the major, minor, and patch release numbers:</P>

<PRE CLASS="command">
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
1.1.0
</PRE>

<P>Beta-test releases are indentified by appending the letter B
followed by the build number:</P>

<PRE CLASS="command">
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCHbBUILD
1.1.0b1
</PRE>

<P>Release candidates are indentified by appending the letters RC
followed by the build number:</P>

<PRE CLASS="command">
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCHrcBUILD
1.1.0rc1
</PRE>

<P>A SVN copy is generated for every beta and final release and
uses the version number preceded by the letter "v" and with the
decimal points replaced by underscores:</P>

<PRE CLASS="command">
v1_1_0b1
v1_1_0rc1
v1_1_0
</PRE>

<P>Each change that corrects a fault in a software sub-system
increments the patch release number. If a change affects the
overall software design of CUPS then the minor release number
will be incremented and the patch release number reset to 0. If
CUPS is completely redesigned the major release number will be
incremented and the minor and patch release numbers reset to
0:</P>

<PRE CLASS="command">
1.1.0b1    First beta release
1.1.0b2    Second beta release
1.1.0rc1   First release candidate
1.1.0rc2   Second release candidate
1.1.0      First production release
1.1.1b1    First beta of 1.1.1
1.1.1rc1   First release candidate of 1.1.1
1.1.1      Production release of 1.1.1
1.1.2b1    First beta of 1.1.2
1.1.2rc1   First release candidate of 1.1.2
1.1.2      Production release of 1.1.2
2.0.0b1    First beta of 2.0.0
2.0.0rc1   First release candidate of 2.0.0
2.0.0      Production release of 2.0.0
</PRE>

<H3>Generation</H3>

<P>Software releases shall be generated for each successfully
completed software trouble report. All object and executable
files shall be deleted prior to performing a full build to ensure
that source files are recompiled.</P>

<H3>Testing</H3>

<P>Software testing shall be conducted according to the <A
HREF="spec-stp.html">CUPS Software Test Plan</A>. Failed tests
cause STRs to be generated to correct the problems found.</P>

<H3>Releases</H3>

<P>When testing has been completed successfully a new
distribution image is created from the current CVS code
"snapshot". No release shall contain software that has not
passed the appropriate software tests. Three types of releases
are used, beta, release candidate, and production, and are
released using the following basic schedule:

<DIV CLASS="table"><TABLE SUMMARY="">
<tr>
	<th>Week</th>
	<th>Version</th>
	<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>T-6 weeks</td>
	<td>1.1.0b1</td>
	<td>First beta</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>T-5 weeks</td>
	<td>1.1.0b2</td>
	<td>Second beta</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>T-4 weeks</td>
	<td>1.1.0b3</td>
	<td>Third beta</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>T-3 weeks</td>
	<td>1.1.0rc1</td>
	<td>First release candidate</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>T-2 weeks</td>
	<td>1.1.0rc2</td>
	<td>Second release candidate</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>T-0 weeks</td>
	<td>1.1.0</td>
	<td>Production</td>
</tr>
</TABLE></DIV>
    
<P>Beta releases are typically used prior to new major and minor
version releases. At least one release candidate is generated
prior to each production release.</P>

<H4>Beta Releases</H4>

<P>Beta releases are generated when substantial changes have
been made that may affect the reliability of the software. Beta
releases may cause loss of data, functionality, or services and
are provided for testing by qualified individuals.</P>

<P>Beta releases are an OPTIONAL part of the release process and
are generated as deemed appropriate by the release coordinator.
Functional changes may be included in subsequent beta releases
until the first release candidate.</P>

<H4>Release Candidates</H4>

<P>Release candidates are generated at least two weeks prior to a
production release. Release candidates are targeted for end-users
that wish to test new functionality or bug fixes prior to the
production release. While release candidates are intended to be
substantially bug-free, they may still contain defects and/or not
compile on specific platforms.</P>

<P>At least one release candidate is REQUIRED prior to any
production release. The distribution of a release candidate marks
the end of any functional improvements. Release candidates are
generated at weekly intervals until all level 4/5 trouble reports
are resolved.</P>

<H4>Production Releases</H4>

<P>Production releases are generated after a successful release
candidate and represent a stable release of the software suitable
for all users.</P>


<H2 CLASS="title"><A NAME="CODING">Coding Requirements</A></H2>

<P>These coding requirements provide detailed information on
source file formatting and documentation content. These
guidelines shall be applied to all C and C++ source files
provided with CUPS. Source code for other languages should
conform to these requirements as allowed by the language.</P>

<H3>Source Files</H3>

<H4>Naming</H4>

<P>All source files names shall be 16 characters or less in
length to ensure compatibility with older UNIX filesystems.
Source files containing functions shall have an extension of ".c"
for ANSI C and ".cxx" for C++ source files. All other "include"
files shall have an extension of ".h".</P>

<H4>Documentation</H4>

<P>The top of each source file shall contain a header giving the
name of the file, the purpose or nature of the source file, the
copyright and licensing notice, and the functions contained in
the file.  The file name and revision information is provided by
the Subversion "&#36;Id$" tag:</P>

</PRE>

<P>The bottom of each source file shall contain a trailer giving
the name of the file using the Subversion "&#36;Id$" tag. The
primary purpose of this is to mark the end of a source file; if
the trailer is missing it is possible that code has been lost
near the end of the file:</P>

<PRE CLASS="command">
/*
 * End of "&#36;Id$".
 */
</PRE>

<H3>Functions</H3>

<H4>Naming</H4>

<P>Functions with a global scope shall be capitalized ("DoThis",
"DoThat", "DoSomethingElse", etc.) The only exception to this
rule shall be the CUPS interface library functions which may
begin with a prefix word in lowercase ("cupsDoThis",
"cupsDoThat", etc.)</P>

<P>Functions with a local scope shall be declared "static" and be
lowercase with underscores between words ("do_this", "do_that",
"do_something_else", etc.)</P>

<H4>Documentation</H4>

<P>Each function shall begin with a comment header describing
what the function does, the possible input limits (if any), and
the possible output values (if any), and any special information
needed:</P>

<PRE CLASS="command">
/*

 *
 * Notes: none.
 */

static float     /* O - Inverse power value, 0.0 &lt;= y &lt;= 1.1 */
do_this(float x) /* I - Power value (0.0 &lt;= x &lt;= 1.1) */
{
  ...
  return (y);
}

  return (y);
}
</PRE>

<P>Return/output values are indicated using an "O" prefix, input
values are indicated using the "I" prefix, and values that are
both input and output use the "IO" prefix for the corresponding
in-line comment.</P>

<H3>Variables</H3>

<H4>Naming</H4>

only exception to this rule shall be the CUPS interface library
global variables which must begin with the prefix "cups"
("cupsThisVariable", "cupsThatVariable", etc.) Global variables
shall be replaced by function arguments whenever possible.</P>

<P>Variables with a local scope shall be lowercase with
underscores between words ("this_variable", "that_variable",
etc.) Any local variables shared by functions within a source
file shall be declared "static".</P>

<H4>Documentation</H4>

<P>Each variable shall be declared on a separate line and shall
be immediately followed by a comment block describing the
variable:</P>

<PRE CLASS="command">

to describe the operations being performed by a group of
statements:</P>

<PRE CLASS="command">
/*
 * Clear the state array before we begin...
 */

for (i = 0; i &lt; (sizeof(array) / sizeof(sizeof(array[0])); i ++)

new line after the brace and is indented 2 spaces. The closing
brace is then placed on a new line following the code at the
original indentation:</P>

<PRE CLASS="command">
{
  int i; /* Looping var */

 /*
  * Process foobar values from 0 to 999...
  */

  for (i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i ++)
