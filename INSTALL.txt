INSTALL - CUPS v1.1.5 - 11/12/2000
----------------------------------

This file describes how to compile and install CUPS from source code.
For more information on CUPS see the file called "README.txt".  A
complete change log can be found in "CHANGES.txt".


BEFORE YOU BEGIN

You'll need ANSI-compliant C and C++ compilers, plus a make program
and Bourne shell.  The GNU compiler tools work well - we've tested
the current CUPS code against GCC 2.95.x with excellent results.

The makefiles used by the project should work with all versions of
make.  We've tested them with GNU make as well as the make programs
shipped by Compaq, HP, SGI, and Sun.

Besides these tools you'll want the following libraries:

    - JPEG 6b or higher
    - PNG 1.0.6 or higher
    - TIFF 3.4 or higher
    - ZLIB 1.1.3 or higher

CUPS will compile and run without these, however you'll miss out on
many of the features provided by CUPS.


CONFIGURATION

CUPS uses GNU autoconf, so you should find the usual "configure"
script in the main CUPS source directory.  To configure CUPS for
your system, type:

    ./configure
