<H1>Scope</H1>

<H2>Identification</H2>

This software security report provides an analysis of possible security
concerns for the Common UNIX Printing System ("CUPS") Version 1.0.</P>

<H2>System Overview</H2>

The Common UNIX Printing System provides a portable printing layer for 
UNIX&reg; operating systems. It has been developed by Easy Software 
Products to promote a standard printing solution for all UNIX vendors 
and users. CUPS provides the System V and Berkeley command-line interfaces.

<P>CUPS uses the Internet Printing Protocol (IETF-IPP) as the basis
for managing print jobs and queues. The Line Printer Daemon (LPD,
RFC1179), Server Message Block (SMB), and AppSocket protocols are also
supported with reduced functionality.

<P>CUPS adds network printer browsing and PostScript Printer
Description (&quot;PPD&quot;)-based printing options to support real
world applications under UNIX.

<P>CUPS also includes a customized version of GNU GhostScript
(currently based off GNU GhostScript 4.03) and an image file RIP that
can be used to support non-PostScript printers.

<H1>Local Access Risks</H1>

<P>Local access risks are those that can be exploited only with a local user
account. This section does not address issues related to dissemination of the
root password or other security issues associated with the UNIX operating
system.

<H2>Security Breaches</H2>

<P>There are two known security vulnerabilities with local access:

<OL>

	<LI>Since the default installation creates a world-readable
	request directory, it is possible for local users to read the
	contents of print files before they are printed.

	<P>This problem can be alleviated by making the request
	directory readable only by the user specified in the CUPS
	configuration file.

	<LI>Device URIs are passed to backend filters in argv[0] and in
	an environment variable. Since device URIs can contain
	usernames and passwords it may be possible for a local user to
	gain access to a remote resource.

	<P>We recommend that any password-protected accounts used for
	remote printing have limited access priviledges so that the
	possible damages can be minimized.

	<P>The device URI is "sanitized" (the username and password are
	removed) when sent to an IPP client so that a remote user
	cannot exploit this vulnerability.

</OL>

<H1>Remote Access Risks</H1>

<P>Remote access risks are those that can be exploited without a local user
account and/or from a remote system. This section does not address issues
related to network or firewall security.

<H2>Denial of Service Attacks</H2>

<P>Like all Internet services, the CUPS server is vulnerable to denial of
service attacks, including:

<OL>

	<LI>Establishing multiple connections to the server until the server
	will accept no more.

	<P>This cannot be protected against by the current software. It
	is possible that future versions of the CUPS software could be
	configured to limit the number of connections allowed from a
	single host, however that still would not prevent a determined
	attack.

	<LI>Repeatedly opening and closing connections to the server as fast
	as possible.

	<P>There is no easy way of protecting against this in the CUPS
	software. If the attack is coming from outside the local
	network it might be possible to filter such an attack, however
	once the connection request has been received by the server it
	must at least accept the connection to find out who is
	connecting.

	<LI>Flooding the network with broadcast packets on port 631.

	<P>It might be possible to disable browsing if this condition
	is detected by the CUPS software, however if there are large
	numbers of printers available on the network such an algorithm
	might think that an attack was occurring when instead a valid
	update was being received.

	<LI>Sending partial IPP requests; specifically, sending part of an
	attribute value and then stopping transmission.

	<P>The current code is structured to read and write the IPP
	request data on-the-fly, so there is no easy way to protect
	against this for large attribute values.

	<LI>Sending large/long print jobs to printers, preventing other users
	from printing.

	<P>There are limited facilities for protecting against large print
	jobs (the <CODE>MaxRequestSize</CODE> attribute), however this will
	not protect printers from malicious users and print files that
	generate hundreds or thousands of pages. In general, we recommend
	restricting printer access to known hosts or networks, and adding
	user-level access control as needed for expensive printers.

</OL>

<H2>Security Breaches</H2>

<P>The current CUPS server only supports Basic authentication with
usernames and passwords. This essentially places the clear text of the
username and password on the network. Since CUPS uses the UNIX username
and password account information, the authentication information could
be used to gain access to accounts (possibly priviledged accounts) on
the server.

<P>The default CUPS configuration disables remote administration. We do
not recommend that remote administration be enabled for all hosts,
however if you have a trusted network or subnet access can be
restricted accordingly.

<P>The next minor release of CUPS will support Digest authentication of
the entire message body using separate MD5-based username and password
files. This will protect password information and prevent unauthorized
access due to compromised account passwords.
