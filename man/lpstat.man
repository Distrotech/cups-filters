.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBlpstat\fR displays status information about the current classes, jobs, and
printers. When run with no arguments, \fBlpstat\fR will list jobs queued by
the user. Other options include:
.TP 5
\-E
.br
Forces encryption when connecting to the server.
.TP 5
\-a [\fIprinter(s)\fR]
.br
Shows the accepting state of printer queues. If no printers are
specified then all printers are listed.
.TP 5
\-c [\fIclass(es)\fR]
.br
Shows the printer classes and the printers that belong to them. If no
classes are specified then all classes are listed.
.TP 5
\-d
.br

.TP 5
\-h \fIserver\fR

.TP 5
\-l
.br
Shows a long listing of printers, classes, or jobs.
.TP 5
\-o [\fIdestination(s)\fR]
.br
Shows the jobs queue on the specified destinations. If no destinations are
specified all jobs are shown.
.TP 5

Shows the printers and whether or not they are enabled for printing. If
no printers are specified then all printers are listed.

.TP 5
\-s
.br
Shows a status summary, including the default destination, a
list of classes and their member printers, and a list of printers and
their associated devices. This is equivalent to using the "-d", "-c",
and "-v" options.
.TP 5
\-t
.br
Shows all status information. This is equivalent to using the "-r",
"-d", "-c", "-v", "-a", "-p", and "-o" options.
.TP 5
\-u [\fIuser(s)\fR]
.br
Shows a list of print jobs queued by the specified users. If no users
are specified, lists the jobs queued by the current user.
.TP 5
\-v [\fIprinter(s)\fR]
.br
Shows the printers and what device they are attached to. If no printers
are specified then all printers are listed.
.TP 5
\-W [\fIwhich-jobs\fR]
.br
Specifies which jobs to show, \fIcompleted\fR or
\fInot-completed\fR (the default). This option \fBmust\fR appear
before the \fI-o\fR option and/or any printer names, otherwise
the default (not-completed) value will be used in the request to
the scheduler.
.SH COMPATIBILITY
Unlike the System V printing system, CUPS allows printer names
to contain any printable character except SPACE and TAB. Also,
printer and class names are \fBnot\fR case-sensitive.
.LP
The "-h" and "-W" options are unique to CUPS.
.LP
The Solaris "-f", "-P", and "-S" options are silently ignored.
