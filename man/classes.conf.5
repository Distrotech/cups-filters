       The  _c_l_a_s_s_e_s_._c_o_n_f  file  defines the local printer classes
       that  are  available.  It  is  normally  located  in   the
       _/_e_t_c_/_c_u_p_s  directory and is generated automatically by the
       _c_u_p_s_d_(_8_)  program  when  printer  classes  are  added   or
       deleted.

       Each  line in the file can be a configuration directive, a
       blank line, or a comment. Comment lines start with  the  #
       character.
