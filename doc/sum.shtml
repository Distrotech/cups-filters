<H1 ALIGN=RIGHT>Preface</H1>

This software users manual describes how to use the Common UNIX Printing
System ("CUPS") Version 1.0.0.

<H2>System Overview</H2>

The Common UNIX Printing System provides a portable printing layer for 
UNIX&reg; operating systems. It has been developed by Easy Software 
Products to promote a standard printing solution for all UNIX vendors 
and users. CUPS provides the System V and Berkeley command-line interfaces.

<P>CUPS uses the Internet Printing Protocol (IETF-IPP) as the basis
for managing print jobs and queues. The Line Printer Daemon (LPD,
RFC1179), Server Message Block (SMB), and AppSocket protocols are also
supported with reduced functionality.

<P>CUPS adds network printer browsing and PostScript Printer
Description (&quot;PPD&quot;)-based printing options to support real
world applications under UNIX.

<H1 ALIGN=RIGHT>1 - Printing System Overview</H1>

<P>This chapter provides an overview of how the Common UNIX Printing System
works.

<H2>The Printing Problem</H2>

<P>For years <I>the printing problem</I> has plagued UNIX&reg;. Unlike
Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; or MacOS, UNIX has no standard interface or
system in place for supporting printers. Among the solutions previously
available, the Berkeley and System V printing systems are the most
prevalent.

<P>These printing systems support line printers (text only) or
PostScript printers (text and graphics), and with some coaxing they can
be made to support a full range of printers and file formats. However,
because each varient of the UNIX operating system uses a different
printing system than the next, developing printer drivers for a wide
range of printers is extremely difficult. That combined with the
limited volume of customers for each UNIX varient has forced most
printer vendors to give up supporting UNIX entirely.

<P>The Common UNIX Printing System, or CUPS, is designed to eliminate
<I>the printing problem</I>. One common printing system can be used by
all UNIX varients to support the printing needs of users. Printer
vendors can use its modular filter interface to develop a single driver
program that supports a wide range of file formats with little or no
effort.  Since CUPS provides both the System V and Berkeley printing
commands, users (and applications) can reap the benefits of this new
technology with no changes.

<H2>The Technology</H2>

<P>CUPS is based upon an emerging Internet standard called the Internet
Printing Protocol, or IPP. IPP has been embraced by dozens of printer
and printer server manufacturers, and will be supported by the next
Microsoft Windows operating system.

<P>IPP defines a standard protocol for printing as well as managing print
jobs and printer options like media size, resolution, and so forth. Like all
IP-based protocols, IPP can be used locally or over the Internet to printers
hundreds or thousands of miles away. Unlike other protocols, however, IPP
also supports access control, authentication, and encryption, making it a
much more secure printing solution than older ones.

<P>IPP is layered on top of the Hyper-Text Transport Protocol, or HTTP,
which is the basis of web servers on the Internet. This allows the user to
view documentation and status information on a printer or server using their
web browser.

<P>CUPS provides a complete IPP/1.0-based printing system that provides Basic
authentication and domain or IP-based access control. Digest authentication
and TLS encryption will be available in future versions of CUPS.

<H2>Filters</H2>

<P>Filters allow a user or application to print many types of files
without extra effort. Print jobs sent to a CUPS server are filtered
before sending them to a printer. Some filters convert job files to
different formats that the printer can understand. Others perform page
selection and ordering tasks. <I>Backend</I> filters perform the most
important task of all - they send the filtered print data to the
printer.

<P>CUPS provides filters for printing many types of image files,
HP-GL/2 files, PDF files, and text files. CUPS also supplies
PostScript and image file Raster Image Processors, or RIPs, that
convert PostScript or image files into bitmaps that can be sent to a
raster printer.

<P>CUPS provides backends for printing over parallel and serial ports,
and over the network via the JetDirect (AppSocket), Server Message
Block, and Line Printer Daemon protocols.

<H2>Printer Drivers</H2>

<P>Printer drivers in CUPS consist of one of more filters specific to a
printer. CUPS includes a sample printer driver for Hewlett-Packard
LaserJet and DeskJet printers. While this driver does not generate
optimal output for different printer models, it does demonstrate how
you can write your own printer drivers and incorporate them into CUPS.
