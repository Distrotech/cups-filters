<P>The <VAR>access_log</VAR> file lists each HTTP resource that is accessed
by a web browser or ESP Print Pro/IPP client. Each line is in the so-called "Common
Log Format" used by many web servers and web reporting tools:

<UL><PRE>
host group user date-time \"method resource version\" status bytes

127.0.0.1 - - [20/May/1999:19:20:29 +0000] "POST /admin/ HTTP/1.1" 401 0
127.0.0.1 - mike [20/May/1999:19:20:31 +0000] "POST /admin/ HTTP/1.1" 200 0
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <I>host</I> field will normally only be an IP address unless you
have enabled the <A HREF="#HostNameLookups"><CODE>HostNameLookups</CODE></A>
directive in the <VAR>cupsd.conf</VAR> file.

<P>The <I>group</I> field always contains "-" in ESP Print Pro.

<P>The <I>user</I> field is the authenticated username of the requesting user.
If no username and password is supplied for the request then this field
contains "-".

<P>The <I>date-time</I> field is the date and time of the request in Greenwich
Mean Time (a.k.a. ZULU) and is in the format:

<UL><PRE>
[DD/MON/YYYY:HH:MM:SS +0000]
</PRE></UL>

<P>The <I>method</I> field is the HTTP method used ("GET", "PUT", "POST", etc.)

<P>The <I>resource</I> field is the filename of the requested resource.

<P>The <I>version</I> field is the HTTP specification version used by the
client. For ESP Print Pro clients this will always be "HTTP/1.1".

<P>The <I>status</I> field contains the HTTP result status of the
request. Usually it is "200", but other HTTP status codes are possible.
For example, 401 is the "unauthorized access" status in the example
above.

<P>The <I>bytes</I> field contains the number of bytes in the request.
For POST requests the <I>bytes</I> field contains the number of bytes
of non-IPP data that is received from the client.
