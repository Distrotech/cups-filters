	- The scheduler did not report Bonjour shared printers as
	  remote printers (STR #2384)
	- Added new -R and -W options to the cupstestppd program
	  for greater control over the testing of PPDs.
	- Added a new cupsGetServerPPD() function for getting
	  an available PPD from the server (STR #2334)
	- Added a new cupsDoIORequest() function for reading
	  and writing files via IPP requests (STR #2334)
	- Added a new CUPS_GET_PPD operation for getting an
	  available PPD file on the server (STR #2334) 
	- CUPS_GET_PPDS now reports multiple ppd-product values
	  based on the PPD ModelName and Product strings (STR
	  #2334, STR #2383)

	  from a PPD file in the ppd-psversion attribute

	  (STR #2240)
	- backendRunLoop() now aborts immediately on SIGTERM
	  if no data has been written yet (STR #2103)

	  (socket://address) and 515 (lpd://address) printing
	  (STR #2035, STR #2354)

	  policy options on raw printers and classes (STR #2238)

	  functions to get the current index and insertion
	  positions of an array.

	- Added support for IntelliBar label printers.
