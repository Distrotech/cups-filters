.SH NAME
lpc \- line printer control program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lpc
[
.I command
[
.I parameter(s)
] ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIlpc\fR provides limited control over printer and class queues provided by
CUPS. It can also be used to query the state of queues.
.LP
If no command is specified on the command-line, \fRlpc\fR will display a
prompt and accept commands from the standard input.
.SH COMMANDS
The \fIlpc\fR program accepts a subset of commands accepted by the Berkeley
\fIlpc\fR program of the same name:
.TP 5
\fIexit
.br
Exits the command interpreter.
.TP 5
help \fI[command]\fR
.br
Displays a short help message.
.TP 5
quit
.br
Exits the command interpreter.
.TP 5
status \fI[queue]\fR
.br
Displays the status of one or more printer or class queues.
.TP 5
? \fI[command]\fR
.br
Display a short help message.
.SH LIMITATIONS
Since \fIlpc\fR is geared towards the Berkeley printing system, it is impossible
to use \fIlpc\fR to configure printer or class queues provided by CUPS.  To
configure printer or class queues you must use the \fIlpadmin(8)\fR command
or another CUPS-compatible client with that functionality.
.SH COMPATIBILITY
The CUPS version of \fIlpc\fR does not implement all of the standard Berkeley
commands.
