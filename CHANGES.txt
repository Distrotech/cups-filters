	  (STR #2460)
	- The scheduler did not allow "DefaultAuthType None".


CHANGES IN CUPS V1.3rc1

	- cupsAdminGetServerSettings() did not handle </Foo> properly.
	- When lprm and cancel are run with no job ID, they now will
	  cancel the first stopped job if no pending or processing
	  jobs are left in the queue.
	- The scheduler now logs successful print jobs, filter
	  failures, and the job file types at the default log
	  level (STR #2458)
	- The scheduler now logs the usernames it is using for
	  authorization at LogLevel debug instead of debug2 (STR #2448)

	- Added httpGetAuthString() and httpSetAuthString() APIs to get
	  and set the current (cached) authorization string to use for
	  HTTP requests.
	- Updated the default cupsd.conf policy to list the
	  "administrative" operations separately from the "printer
	  control" operations so that it is easier to define a
	  group of users that are "printer operators".
	- The web interface now pulls the default cupsd.conf file
	  from cupsd.conf.default in the CUPS config directory.
	- Added a help file for using Kerberos with CUPS.
	- The scheduler now strips the "@KDC" portion of Kerberos
	  usernames since those usernames typically do not appear in
	  the group membership lists used by CUPS.

	  choices marked.
	- Backends could (incorrectly) run as root during discovery
	  (STR #2454)

	  (STR #2455)

	  (STR #2450)
	- The scheduler now erases authentication cache files using the
	  7-pass US DoD algorithm.
	- Delegated Kerberos credentials (proxy authentication) did not
	  work.
	- The filter makefile did not optimize the libcupsimage.2.dylib
	  with a sectorder file.
	- The IPP backend incorrectly wrote an empty printer message
	  when processing the "none" state reason.

	  shared/published.
	- The scheduler did not remove the temporary request file on
	  authentication errors.
	- ppdLocalizeIPPReason() did not handle "scheme:" schemes or
	  "file" URLs.
	- ppdLocalizeIPPReason() was not exported on Mac OS X.


CHANGES IN CUPS V1.3b1

	- Copyright updates - CUPS is now owned by Apple Inc.
	- Documentation updates (STR #1775, STR #2027, STR #2130,
	  STR #2131, STR #2263, STR #2356, STR #2397)
	- Added new cupsfilter utility (STR #1734)
	- Added new job-printer-state-message and
	  job-printer-state-reasons attributes to jobs (STR #2418)
	- Added LDAP+SSL support (STR #1967)
	- CUPS now supports authentication via peer credentials
	  over domain sockets (STR #2242, STR #2277)
	- The CUPS sample driver PPDs are now generated by the PPD
	  compiler and include all of the localized languages by
	  default (STR #2164)
	- You can now specify "AuthType Default" in the cupsd.conf
	  file to use the default authentication defined by the
	  DefaultAuthType directive.
	- The SNMP backend no longer adds a default Address line
	  when none is specified in the snmp.conf file; this allows
	  the backend to be easily disabled as needed (STR #2434)
	- Added a new cupsctl command for doing basic changes to
	  the cupsd.conf file (STR #1777)
	- Added a new ppdLocalizeIPPReason() function to get the
	  localized text/URI for a given IPP reason keyword for a
	  driver.
	- Removed the deskjet2.ppd driver, as it only worked with
	  a very small subset of HP DeskJet printers and was
	  confusing to users.  The rastertohp driver still
	  supports the deskjet2.ppd options for existing queues.
	- The scheduler did not add a trailing banner page if a
	  client did not specify the last document in a job (STR
	  #1711)
	- The scheduler did not report Bonjour shared printers as
	  remote printers (STR #2384)
	- Added new -R and -W options to the cupstestppd program
	  for greater control over the testing of PPDs.
	- Added a new cupsGetServerPPD() function for getting
	  an available PPD from the server (STR #2334)
	- Added a new cupsDoIORequest() function for reading
	  and writing files via IPP requests (STR #2334)

	  based on the PPD ModelName and Product strings (STR
	  #2334, STR #2383)

	  from a PPD file in the ppd-psversion attribute
	  (STR #2334)
	- CUPS_GET_PPDS now reports the cupsModelNumber attribute
	  from a PPD file in the ppd-model-number attribute (STR
	  #2383)
	- CUPS_GET_PPDS now reports a driver type string in the
	  ppd-type attribute based on the cupsFax and cupsFilter
	  attributes in a PPD file (STR #2383)
	- Added a new printer attribute called "cups-version"
	  which reports the version of CUPS that is running
	  (STR #2240)
	- backendRunLoop() now aborts immediately on SIGTERM
	  if no data has been written yet (STR #2103)
	- Due to poor IPP support from the vendors, the SNMP
	  backend no longer tries IPP connections; instead,
	  it now uses a lookup file with fallback to port 9100
	  (socket://address) and 515 (lpd://address) printing
	  (STR #2035, STR #2354) 
	- The scheduler now recreates the CUPS log directory as

          of array elements (STR #2358)
        - ppdConflicts() optimizations (STR #2358)
	- The cupstestppd program now tests for existing filters,
	  icons, profiles, and dialog extensions (STR #2326)

	  main administration page.  Instead, a new "List Available
	  Printers" button is provided that shows a separate page
	  with the list of printers.
	- The web interface now supports setting the banner and
	  policy options on raw printers and classes (STR #2238)
	- The socket backend now reads any pending back-channel
	  data before shutting down the socket (STR #2325)
	- Added a new ErrorPolicy directive in the cupsd.conf
	  file (STR #1871)
	- Printers that use JCL options are now exported to Samba
	  correctly (STR #1985)
	- The IPP backend now relays printer-state-message values
	  from the server to the client (STR #2109)

	  from PPD files in CUPS-Get-PPDs responses (STR #1900)

	  for creating web interface buttons (STR #2231)
	- Added support for DNS-SD (aka "Bonjour") printer sharing
	  (STR #1171)
	- Job operations (cancel, hold, release, etc.) from the
	  web interface now return back to the original page (STR
	  #2239)

	  successful deletion from the web interface (STR #1999)
	- The default configuration now allows browse packets from
	  any address (STR #2008)
	- The web interface now provides an "allow printing from the
	  Internet" check box (STR #1897)
	- The notify-events-default and
	  notify-lease-duration-default attributes can now be set
	  (STR #1671)
	- Server-side default options are now sent to clients when
	  the "printer-defaults" attribute group is requested (STR
	  #1923)
	- Added support for Linux "relro" linker option (STR #1614)
	- CUPS now validates the number-up option value (STR #1329)
	- The on-line help now provides better search capabilities

	  to change the printer name, description,  and location
	  (STR #1646)

	  instead of select() when possible (STR #1261)
	- Added new cupsArrayGetIndex() and cupsArrayGetInsert()
	  functions to get the current index and insertion
	  positions of an array.

	  which specifies the character set that is used in PJL
	  strings (STR #1969)
	- Moved the definition of the (private) _http_s structure
	  to http-private.h; code that directly accesses the
	  http_t members will no longer compile!
	- Added support for setting the document-format-default
	  attribute on a per-printer basis.
	- Added support for IntelliBar label printers.
