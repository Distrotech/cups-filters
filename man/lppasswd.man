.TH lppasswd 1 "Common UNIX Printing System" "7 June 2001" "Easy Software Products"
.SH NAME
lppasswd \- add, change, or delete digest passwords.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lppasswd
[ -a ] [ -g
.I groupname
] [ -x ] [
.I username
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIlppasswd\fR adds, changes, or deletes passwords in the CUPS digest
password file, \fIpasswd.md5\fR. When run by a normal user, \fIlppasswd\fR
will prompt for the old and new passwords. When run by the super-user,
\fIlppasswd\fR can add new accounts (\fI-a username\fR), change existing
accounts (\fIusername\fR), or delete accounts (\fI-x username\fR) in the
digest password file. Digest usernames do not have to match local UNIX
usernames, but only UNIX usernames are supported by the CUPS client programs
(\fIlp(1)\fR, \fIlpr(1)\fR, etc.)
.LP
The \fI-g\fR option specifies a group other than the system group - "sys",
"system", or "root", depending on the operating system.
.SH SECURITY ISSUES
The \fIlppasswd\fR command is installed setuid to root. While every attempt
has been made to make it secure against exploits that could grant super-user
priviledges to unpriviledged users, paranoid system administrators may wish
to disable or change the ownership of the program to an unpriviledged
account.
